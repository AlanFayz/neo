The Profound Thoughts of a Great Man.
Greatness is not merely an attribute bestowed upon an individual by
characteristics of their achievements or accolades. It is a reflection of the
depth and breadth of their thoughts, their insatiable curiosity, wisdom and
their relentless pursuit of truth. A great man is one who ponders upon
questions that transcend the mundane, questions that delve into the very
essence of existence and reality. This writing aims to shed light on some of
these profound thoughts that distinguish a great man from the rest.
The Workings of the Universe:
One of the most significant questions that intrigues a great man is the
mystery of the universe. How did it come into being? What are the laws that
govern it? What is its ultimate fate? These questions are not merely
academic, but have profound implications for our understanding of ourselves
and our place in the cosmos. A great man is one who is not content with
superficial explanations, but seeks to unravel the complex tapestry of the
universe, one thread at a time.
The Mechanism of Nature:
Closely related to the question of the universe is the mystery of nature. A
great man is one who is in awe of the beauty and complexity of the natural
world, and seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive it.
From the intricate dance of the planets to the delicate balance of
ecosystems, a great man is one who sees the hand of a master craftsman at
work, and seeks to decipher the blueprint of creation. He tries to understand
the true nature.
{11}
The Conquest of Death:
One of the most universal and enduring questions that haunts a great man is
the mystery of death. Is it the end of the road, or merely a pit-stop on a
larger journey? What lies beyond the veil of mortality? A great man with
wisdom is one who is not content with merely accepting death as an
inevitable fact of life, but seeks to understand its true nature, and perhaps,
even find a way to conquer it.
The Alleviation of Suffering:
Another question that weighs heavily on the mind of a great man is the
problem of suffering. Why is there pain and sorrow in the world? How can we
alleviate it? A great man is one who is not only sensitive to the suffering of
others, but also proactive in seeking solutions to mitigate it. A great man with
wisdom is one who is committed to the cause of alleviating suffering or
finding an eternal solution to the suffering.
The Ultimate Truth:
Perhaps the most profound and elusive question that a great man grapples
with is the nature of truth itself. What is the ultimate reality? What is the
true nature? Is there a grand unifying theory that can explain everything? A
great man is one who is not content with dogmatic or parochial views of the
world, but seeks to transcend the boundaries of culture, religion, and
ideology in the pursuit of a deeper, more universal and real truth.
The Eternal Nature:
Finally, a great man is one who ponders upon the nature of eternity. Is time
an illusion, or a fundamental aspect of reality? What is the meaning of life in
a universe that may be infinite in extent? A great man with wisdom is one
who is not only concerned with the here and now, but also with the grand
tapestry of past, present, and future, and seeks to understand the role that
we play in this cosmic drama.
{12}
In summary, the thoughts of a great man are not confined to the narrow and
the mundane, but encompass the broadest and deepest questions of
existence, nature, universe and reality. They are not merely intellectual
exercises, but have profound implications for our understanding of ourselves
and our place in the cosmos. As we strive to achieve greatness in our own
lives, let us be inspired by these profound thoughts of a supreme man, and
seek to cultivate a mind that is curious, courageous, and committed to the
pursuit of truth…
Brain-Dead but Alive? Case of the
Beating-Heart Cadaver.
The concept of brain death is widely accepted in the medical and legal
communities as the complete and irreversible loss of all brain function,
including brainstem function. When an individual is determined to be braindead, they are legally and clinically dead, as the brain is responsible for
maintaining the body's overall functioning and integration. However, the
individual's heart may continue to beat for a period of time with the use of
mechanical ventilation and other life-sustaining treatments, leading to the
phenomenon of the "beating-heart cadaver" or "heart-beating donor." This
raises a number of ethical and philosophical questions, including the nature
of consciousness and the relationship between the brain and the mind.
The Case of the Beating-Heart Cadaver:
In cases where an individual is determined to be brain-dead but their heart
continues to beat, the use of machines is often done for the purpose of organ
{13}
donation. The individual's organs can be removed and transplanted into
other individuals who are in need of them, potentially saving multiple lives.
However, the idea of a body that is technically dead but still functioning with
the help of machines is a controversial one, and has led to debates over the
definition of death and the ethics of organ donation.
The phenomenon of the beating-heart cadaver also raises questions about
the nature of consciousness and the relationship between the brain and the
mind. If the brain is completely and irreversibly dead, how is it possible for
the body to continue functioning, even with the help of machines? And if the
body is technically dead, but the heart is still beating, is there some form of
consciousness or awareness present? What is the true nature of this case?
These questions touch on one of the greatest mysteries of science, religion
and philosophy: the nature of consciousness and the relationship between
the brain and the mind. While the brain is clearly involved in the process of
consciousness, the exact nature of this relationship is still not well
understood. What we know is little. Some materialistic scientific theories
suggest that consciousness arises from the complex interactions of neurons
in the brain, while other theories and philosophies propose that
consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe, like space and time,
and that the brain simply acts as a receiver or filter for this universal
consciousness.
The idea that consciousness is not solely located in the brain is supported by
a number of phenomena, including near-death experiences, out-of-body
experiences, and the use of psychedelic drugs, which can all produce
profound changes in consciousness and perception that are not easily
explained by brain activity alone. Science is still unable to explain everything.
Despite the advances and discoveries made through scientific research, there
remain aspects of the universe, nature, or existence that science has not yet
been able to fully understand or explain.
The phenomenon of the beating-heart cadaver is a complex and controversial
one, touching on issues of ethics, the definition of death, and the nature of
consciousness. While the brain is clearly involved in the process of
consciousness too, the exact nature of this relationship is still not well
{14}
understood, and the idea that consciousness is not solely located in the brain
is supported by a number of phenomena.
Ultimately, the mystery of consciousness is one that may never be fully
solved by the materialistic science, as it touches on the deepest questions of
existence and the nature of reality. However, by continuing to explore and
investigate the nature of the mind and consciousness, we may gain valuable
insights into the human experience and the mysteries of the universe…
What is a Near Death Experience?
Near-death experiences (NDEs) are profound and often life-changing events
that have been reported by people from all walks of life and all parts of the
world. NDEs typically occur when a person is on the brink of death or in a
state of clinical death, and they often involve a range of mystical and spiritual
experiences that are difficult to explain or understand.
One of the most common features of NDEs is a sense of leaving the body and
floating above it, often accompanied by a feeling of peace, serenity, and
detachment. Some people also report seeing a bright light or a tunnel, and
encountering deceased loved ones, spiritual beings, or other entities. Many
NDEs also involve a review of one's life, where the person is able to see and
understand the consequences of their actions and decisions, and to
experience a sense of compassion, forgiveness, and love.
NDEs can have a profound and lasting impact on a person's life, and they
often lead to a greater sense of purpose, meaning, and spirituality. Many
people who have had NDEs report a heightened sense of awareness and
intuition, and a greater appreciation for the beauty and wonder of the world
{15}
around them. They may also experience a shift in their values and priorities,
and a greater desire to help others and to make a positive difference in the
world.
Despite the widespread reports of NDEs, there is still much debate and
uncertainty about their nature and causes. Some researchers and skeptics
argue that NDEs are simply a byproduct of the brain's response to trauma,
stress, or lack of oxygen, and that they have no real spiritual or mystical
significance. Others, however, argue that NDEs are evidence of a deeper and
more profound reality that is beyond the physical and materialistic world,
and that they offer a glimpse into the nature of consciousness, the afterlife,
and the ultimate purpose of human existence.
Regardless of one's beliefs or opinions about NDEs, it is clear that they are a
fascinating and complex phenomenon that deserves further study and
exploration. By deepening our understanding of NDEs and their effects, we
may be able to gain new insights into the nature of consciousness, the mindbody connection, and the mysteries of the universe. We may also be able to
help those who have had NDEs to integrate their experiences into their lives,
and to find a sense of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in the process.
However, according to the ancient scriptures, the Near Death Experience is as
follows: There happens the real death of that person, and they become a
spontaneous invisible being for a short time. Then, after a while, due to the
strong desire for the previous human life and belongings and powerful karma
yet available for a human life, they die again from the spontaneous invisible
spirit life, and their consciousness re-enters the human body. The ancient
scriptures mention that when most of the spontaneous beings, such as
spirits, die, their body vanishes instantly with a remainder.
In summary, what we know is little and near-death experiences are profound
and often life-changing events that have been reported by people from all
walks of life and all parts of the world. They typically involve a range of
mystical and spiritual experiences that are difficult to explain or understand,
and they can have a profound and lasting impact on a person's life.
Materialistic modern science is incapable of explaining how Near Death
Experiences occur. Despite the ongoing debate and uncertainty about the
{16}
nature and causes of NDEs in materialistic scientific community, they are a
fascinating and complex phenomenon that deserves further study and
exploration by the modern science, and that may offer valuable insights into
the nature of consciousness, the afterlife, various invisible beings, various
invisible existences and the ultimate purpose of human existence…
Rise of Ghost & Paranormal Investigators
in the United States.
Ghosts and paranormal phenomena have been a source of fascination and
fear for centuries, and the United States of America is no exception. In recent
years, there has been a surge of interest in the paranormal, with numerous
television shows, movies, and books exploring the unknown and the
unexplained.
This has led to the emergence of a new profession: the ghost and paranormal
investigator. These individuals are dedicated to uncovering the truth behind
reports of ghostly apparitions, strange noises, and other unexplained
occurrences. They use a variety of tools and techniques, including
electromagnetic field (EMF) detectors, thermal imaging cameras, and audio
recorders, to gather evidence and attempt to communicate with any spirits
that may be present.
In the United States, there are numerous organizations and individuals who
offer ghost and paranormal investigation services. Some of the most wellknown include the Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS), which was founded in
1990 and is based in Rhode Island. TAPS is perhaps best known for its hit
{17}
television show, "Ghost Hunters," which aired on the Syfy network for 11
seasons.
Another prominent organization is the Ghost Research Society (GRS), which
was founded in 1972 and is based in Illinois. The GRS is dedicated to the
scientific study of ghosts and other paranormal phenomena, and offers a
variety of resources and services to those who are interested in the field.
In addition to these organizations, there are numerous independent ghost
and paranormal investigators who operate throughout the United States.
These individuals often have a background in fields such as law enforcement,
psychology, or engineering, and use their unique skills and perspectives to
approach the investigation of paranormal phenomena.
While the field of ghost and paranormal investigation is still relatively new
and largely unregulated, there are efforts being made to establish standards
and best practices. The American Association of Paranormal Investigators
(AAPI) is one such organization, which seeks to promote professionalism and
ethical conduct in the field.
Despite the skepticism of some, the popularity of ghost and paranormal
investigation shows no signs of slowing down. Whether driven by a desire to
uncover the truth, a fascination with the unknown, or a simple love of a good
ghost story, these individuals and organizations will continue to explore the
mysteries of the paranormal for years to come.
In summary, the field of ghost and paranormal investigation is a rapidly
growing and evolving profession in the United States. With numerous
organizations and individuals offering their services, there is a growing effort
to establish standards and best practices in the field. While the existence of
ghosts and other paranormal phenomena remains a topic of debate and
controversy in the materialistic scientific community and atheist community
that does not believe in invisible creatures, the popularity of the field shows
no signs of slowing down…

The Universe: Knowns & Unknowns.
The universe, a term that encapsulates everything that exists, is a thing of
immense scale and complexity. It is a cosmic arena filled with stars, galaxies,
planets, existences and other forms of matter and energy. While we have
made significant strides in understanding the universe, it is important to
acknowledge that what we know is just a tiny fraction compared to what we
do not know.
Our understanding of the universe began with simple observations of the
night sky. The advent of the telescope in the 17th century revolutionized our
understanding, allowing us to see more that the universe is not just limited to
the planets revolving around the Sun, but is teeming with stars and various
galaxies.
In the 20th century, the development of new technologies, such as the
Hubble Space Telescope, further expanded our knowledge. We discovered
that the universe is not only vast but also expanding. We found evidence of
the universe's early days, as we believe, such as cosmic microwave
background radiation, and began to understand the forces and pwritings that
make up the universe.
However, despite these advancements, the universe continues to present us
with mysteries. One of the most significant is dark matter and dark energy.
Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with light or other
parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, making it invisible and extremely hard
to detect. It is believed to make up approximately 27% of the universe. Dark
energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious force that is causing the universe
to expand at an accelerating rate. It is thought to make up about 68% of the
universe.
{19}
Another mystery is the existence of exoplanets and the possibility of
extraterrestrial life. While we have discovered thousands of exoplanets, the
conditions and the potential for life on these planets are still largely
unknown. The search for extraterrestrial life also extends to Mars, one of our
neighboring planets, where signs of ancient life are being explored.
The universe's origins and its ultimate fate are also subjects of much debate
and speculation. The Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted
explanation for the universe's origin by people, but it does not explain what
caused the Big Bang or what (if anything) existed before it. Similarly, while we
know that the universe is expanding, we do not know whether it will
continue to do so indefinitely, or whether it will eventually collapse in on
itself.
In summary, the universe is a vast and complex thing that we have only
begun to understand. While we have made significant strides in unraveling its
mysteries, what we know is dwarfed by what we do not know. The mysteries
of dark matter and dark energy, the potential for extraterrestrial life, and the
universe's real origins and ultimate fate are all questions that continue to
puzzle and inspire wise men…
Shiva & Sumitra past life case.
A Case of the Possession Type in India With Evidence of Paranormal
Knowledge.
(Credit for these reports goes to the respective owners. Credit for this report
goes to Dr. Ian Stevenson, the father of reincarnation research. Dr. Ian
Stevenson, a Canadian-born psychiatrist, is renowned as the father of
{20}
reincarnation research. Over a span of more than 40 years, he meticulously
studied cases of children who claimed to remember past lives, seeking
evidence to support reincarnation. His influential work, including books like
"Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation" and "Children Who Remember
Previous Lives," brought scientific rigor to the field. Stevenson's research
significantly advanced the understanding of consciousness beyond the
physical body and continues to inspire ongoing studies into the human mind
and existence.)

Abstract: A young married woman, Sumitra, in a village of northern
India, apparently died and then revived. After a period of confusion she
stated that she was one Shiva who had been murdered in another village.
She gave enough details to permit verification of her statements, which
corresponded to facts in the life of another young married woman called
Shiva. Shiva had lived in a place about 100 km away, and she had died
violently there-either by suicide or murder-about two months before
Sumitra's apparent death and revival. Subsequently, Sumitra recognized
23 persons (in person or in photographs) known to Shiva. She also showed
in several respects new behavior that accorded with Shiva's personality and
attainments. For example, Shiva's family were Brahmins (high caste),
whereas Sumitra's were Thakurs (second caste); after the change in her
personality Sumitra showed Brahmin habits that were strange in her family.
Extensive interviews with 53 informants satisfied the investigators that
the families concerned had been, as they claimed, completely unknown to
each other before the case developed and that Sumitra had had no normal
knowledge of the people and events in Shiva's life. The authors conclude
that the subject demonstrated knowledge of another person's life obtained
paranormally.
{21}
The word possession designates a wide variety of conditions that
psychiatrists,
psychologists, and anthropologists describe. It indicates that a person
has undergone such a marked change of behavior that other persons seem
no longer to be in contact with the ordinary personality of the affected
person.
Possession states occur widely in India (Carstairs & Kapur, 1976; Teja,
Khanna, & Subrahmanyam, 1970). ' Most psychiatrists, psychologists, and
anthropologists have emphasized the similarities between cases of the
possession
type and diagnostic entities recognized in the West, such as multiple
personality and hysteria. Accordingly, they tend to use phrases such as
"possession syndrome" and "hysterical possession." They also, in varying
degrees, offer motivational explanations of the condition that depict it as
beneficial to the affected person in improving his status and perhaps
resolving
internal and external conflicts. However, Claus ( 1979) cautioned against
psychological and sociological interpretations for all cases until we have
more information. Along the same line, Lewis (1 97 1, pp. 178- 179) wrote:
"Nothing after all is easier than leaping to conclusions and projecting our
own psychological assumptions and interpretations onto exotic evidence
which may correspond only in superficial detail with apparently similar data
in our own culture."
The question arises of whether some ostensibly possessed persons show
knowledge about the life of a deceased person that they could not have
obtained normally. We think that in a small number of cases the subjects do
show such knowledge. Cases of this kind are rare, and yet sufficiently well
known in India so that the Hindi word parakayapravesh ("entering into
another body") exists for designating them. One of us (I.S.) has studied
several cases of the type with evidence of paranormal knowledge2 and has
published reports of two of them (Stevenson, 19661 1 974a, 1983a). Their
occurrence and that of occasional other cases of ostensible possession with
evidence of paranormal processes, such as the case of Uttara Huddar (in
which the subject spoke a language she had not learned and assumed the
personality of a deceased woman completely unknown to her family)
(Stevenson
{22}
& Pasricha, 1979; Stevenson, 1984), have encouraged us to search
for new cases of the possession type with evidence of paranormal processes.
Such evidence is not easily obtained. The ostensibly possessing personalities
(when not gods or godlings) are usually persons known to the subject or
about whom the subject may easily have learned normally. In cases of this
type it is difficult to obtain satisfactory evidence of the subject's having
knowledge paranormally acquired. We believe we have satisfied this criterion
in the case we now report. It involves two completely unrelated and
unacquainted persons. Their families lived in widely separated towns and
villages, and the informants' testimony warrants believing that they had had
no contact with each other before the case developed.
Case Report:
Summary of the Case and its Investigation:
When this case developed, the subject, Sumitra Singh, was a young married
woman of about 17. She was living with her husband and their one
child in her husband's family home (according to the custom in India) in the
village of Sharifpura, in the Farrukhabad District of the State of Uttar
Pradesh, India. Early in 1985 she began to develop episodes of loss of
consciousness with eye-roll movements and clenching of the teeth.
Sometimes
she would speak during these trance-like states, and one day in July
she predicted that she would die three days later. When the predicted day
(July 19) came, she seemed to die. At least members of her family and other
villagers considered her dead, because she was pulseless and apneic, and her
face was drained of blood like that of a dead person. They had begun
grieving and also preparing for Sumitra's funeral, when she unexpectedly
revived.
Following a brief period of confusion Sumitra began to behave like a
different person. She did not recognize the people around her and said that
her name was Shiva and that she had been murdered by her in-laws at a
place called Dibiyapur. She rejected Sumitra's husband and child and asked
to be taken to Shiva's two children. She stated many details that were
subsequently found to correspond with the life of another young married
woman, Shiva Diwedi, who had died violently-whether from murder or
suicide is still unclear-at Dibiyapur on the night of May 18- 19, 1985, that
is, two months before Sumitra's apparent death and revival. Shiva's parental
{23}
family believed that her in-laws had murdered her and then attempted to
simulate suicide by laying her body on railway tracks nearby. Her father,
Ram Siya Tripathi, filed a complaint, and this instituted a judicial inquiry.
Reports of Shiva's death and of the legal proceedings appeared in
newspapers
published in Etawah, the district town where Ram Siya Tripathi
lived.
Sumitra's in-laws said that they knew nothing of a Shiva who had died at a
place called Dibiyapur. At first they thought that Sumitra had gone mad and
later that she had become possessed by a discarnate spirit; but they made no
attempt to verify what she was saying. It was about a month before Ram
Siya Tripathi learned about Sumitra's statements. This occurred, almost
accidentally, when he heard a rumor, while he was visiting Dibiyapur, that
his deceased daughter had taken possession of a girl in a distant village.
Nearly two more months elapsed before he was able to verify this
information
by having someone from a village called Murra, which is close to
Sharifpura, visit Sumitra and her family.
The information gathered corresponded to facts in the life of Ram Siya's
deceased daughter, Shiva, and so on October 20, 1985 Ram Siya went
himself (accompanied by a relative) to Sharifpura, where Sumitra recognized
him and said she was his daughter. Sumitra also recognized in Sharifpura
and Etawah (where she visited Ram Siya during the following days) at
least 13 members of Shiva's family and circle of friends.
In addition to Sumitra's statements about the life of Shiva and her
recognitions
of persons Shiva had known, she showed a marked change in behavior.
Sumitra's family belonged to the Thakur caste and they were villagers
with almost no education; Sumitra herself had had no formal education,
although she could read and write a little. The Tripathis, on the other hand,
were Brahmins and middle-class urbanites. Ram Siya was a lecturer in a
college, and Shiva had been educated up to the level of earning a B.A.
degree. After her revival, Sumitra's behavior changed from that of a simple
village girl to that of a moderately well-educated woman of higher caste and
more urban manners, who could now read and write Hindi fluently.
The case came to our attention soon after the first exchanges of visits
between the families concerned. The Indian Express published a report of
{24}
the case on October 26, 1985. One of I.S.'s correspondents in India noticed
this and sent a copy of the report to him. At about the same time a
correspondent
in northern India sent to S.P. a copy of a report of the case in a
Hindi newspaper, Dainik Jagran, that had appeared on October 23, 1985.
Methods of Investigation:
Our principal method of investigation was interviews with informants,
particularly firsthand witnesses of the apparent death of Sumitra and the
change in her personality that followed her revival; but we spent almost as
much time interviewing the members of Shiva's family.
We were able to begin our interviews within three weeks of learning about
the case. In November 1985, S.P. conducted a series of interviews with some
of the principal informants for it. These included Sumitra and her motherinlaw, Shiva's parents, and one of Shiva's maternal uncles.
In February and March 1986, we worked together on the case for seven
days. We interviewed again all but one of the persons S.P. had interviewed
earlier. In addition, we interviewed numerous other informants for the case,
especially in Sumitra's village of Sharifpura. We met her father in his village,
Angad ka Nagla. We had to seek out other informants in four other towns
and villages of the Farrukhabad District and the neighboring districts of
Etawah, Mainpuri, and Hardoi.
In November 1986, February 1 987, and October 1987 two of us (I.S. and
S.P.) spent another 10 days on fieldwork for the case. During these three
periods we interviewed (in Dibiyapur) Shiva's husband and father-in-law,
whom we had not met earlier. We also interviewed informants who had
connections through marriage or trade with more than one of the
communities
involved in the case; we intended these interviews to help us to assess the
likelihood that information about Shiva's life and death could have reached
Sumitra's family along normal lines of communication. We also, during this
later phase of the investigation, had new interviews with some previous
informants, including Sumitra and her husband and Shiva's parents.
By the end of our investigation in October 1987 we had interviewed 24
members of Sumitra's and Shiva's families, and we had interviewed all the
more important witnesses among these persons two or more times. In
addition,
{25}
we had interviewed another 29 persons who were able to furnish
background information, especially that mentioned above concerning
communications
between the communities involved in the case.
During the interviews S.P. made notes, mostly in Hindi, and also acted as
principal interpreter for I.S. and N.McC-R., both of whom made notes in
English, as nearly verbatim as possible. During a few special interviews we
made tape recordings only, or in addition to making notes.
In our interviews we gave particular attention to the following aspects of
the case: the preceding illness, apparent death, and revival of Sumitra; the
possibilities for normal communication of information about Shiva's life
and death to Sumitra and her family; and the circumstances under which
Sumitra, after her revival, identified Shiva's family in person and in
photographs.
In addition to our interviews we obtained copies of newspaper reports
(published in Etawah) of Shiva's death and of Ram Siya Tripathi's allegations
that her in-laws had murdered her. We also obtained copies of the
photographs of Shiva's family in which Sumitra had correctly identified
persons normally unknown to her before the change in her personality.
One of us (I.S.) has published elsewhere further details of the methods
followed (Stevenson, 19661 1974a, 1975).
Relevant Facts of Geography and Possibilities for Normal Communication
Between the Families Concerned:
This case occurred in the Farrukhabad and Etawah Districts of the State
of Uttar Pradesh. Etawah is a small city of about 100,000 inhabitants located
approximately 500 km southeast of Delhi. It is a district town on the
main line of the railway that joins Delhi to Kanpur (about 250 km east of
Etawah) and, ultimately, to Calcutta. Shiva's parents lived in Etawah from
the time she was three years old until the case developed.
After her marriage Shiva moved to the home of her in-laws at Dibiyapur,
which is about 55 km east of Etawah. Almost adjoining Dibiyapur is the
railway station of Phaphoond, which is on the main railway line linking
Etawah and Kanpur.
Sharifpura, the village where Sumitra was living when the case developed,
is just outside the Etawah District in the Farrukhabad District, about 65 km
north of Etawah and about 100 km (in a direct line) from Dibiyapur. Some
{26}
of Sumitra's in-laws lived in the town of Sikandarpur, which is about 30 km
farther north and west from Sharifpura, in the Farrukhabad District.
Angad ka Nagla, where Sumitra's father lived, is about 15 km east of
Sharifpura and perhaps slightly south.
Informants for Sumitra's side of the case said that they had no previous
acquaintance with Shiva's family, and members of Shiva's family similarly
said they were completely ignorant of Sumitra's family before the case
developed. Apart from the long (for India) geographical distances between
the families, they were further separated by significant differences of caste,
education, and economic position.
Strong support for the informants' denial of prior acquaintance (or
knowledge about each other) comes from the slow and roundabout manner
in which Shiva's family learned about the personality change in Sumitra.
Sumitra's father and her in-laws made no attempt to verify her statements
about Shiva. Word about them first reached the neighboring village of
Murra, which is 2 km from Sharifpura. From there it traveled to Dibiyapur
apparently conveyed by women of Murra who had married and were living
there. Ram Siya Tripathi, on a visit to Dibiyapur, heard a rumor that his
dead daughter had taken possession of a girl in a distant village called
Sharifpura. However, he had never been to Sharifpura and did not even
know where it was located. After another two weeks he learned about a man
called Ram Prakash Dube, a native of Murra who was living in Etawah, but
whom he had not previously known. He asked Ram Prakash Dube to
inquire in Murra about the truth of the account he had heard in Dibiyapur.
The monsoon rains led to further delays. When Ram Prakash Dube next
visited Murra, he looked into the story and confirmed its main outlines to
Ram Siya Tripathi, who, as we have mentioned, then went to Sharifpura
and had his first meeting with Sumitra on October 20, 1985. This was
exactly three months after Sumitra's apparent death and revival. We believe
that if the families concerned had been previously acquainted or had had
any lines of communication through mutual acquaintances, they would
have exchanged information about Sumitra's change of personality much
sooner than they did.
If Ram Siya Tripathi had not complained to the police about the unseemly
haste with which his daughter's body had been cremated (as we shall
describe below), few persons outside those immediately concerned would
have heard about her death. However, when the police began to investigate
{27}
the matter, the newspapers of Etawah took notice and published accounts of
Shiva's death and of the judicial inquiry. Some of the newspapers carrying
these reports reached Sikandarpur, where persons who might have come in
contact with the family of Sumitra's mother-in-law read them. At least one
newspaper with a report also reached a reader of Sharifpura. The brother of
the headman of Sharifpura said that he had read about Shiva's death in a
newspaper before the change in Sumitra; but he gave the matter little
attention
at the time. The headman himself, a schoolteacher, said that he learned
about Shiva's death only after Sumitra's changeover. In addition, we learned
of two traders who went regularly between Sharifpura and Etawah on
business.
After the case developed one of them became acquainted with Ram
Siya Tripathi, but had not known him earlier.
Members of Sumitra's family said that they had heard nothing about
Shiva's death before Sumitra's death, revival, and personality change.
However,
in view of the circulation of some newspapers in their area, and of
some trading between Sharifpura and Etawah, it is best to assume that they
might have learned of Shiva's death and perhaps also learned about some of
the allegations of suicide and homicide that figured in the newspaper
reports.
(There was no radio station in the area. Some television had been
introduced at Etawah only [Sharifpura had no electricity], but it only relayed
programs from Delhi and broadcast no local news.) The newspaper
reports included some of the names of Shiva's parental family and in-laws.
The important question remaining is, therefore, whether Sumitra, after the
change in her personality, demonstrated knowledge and behavior
corresponding
to Shiva's life that went beyond the information available in the
newspapers reporting the death of Shiva and the related judicial inquiry.
The Life, Last Illness, Apparent Death, and Revival of Sumitra:
Sumitra was born in (probably) 196S3 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, where her
father, Chotte Singh, had gone for employment in one of the many textile
mills there. He was a native of Angad ka Nagla, a village of the Etawah
District. He and other members of his family belonged to the Thakur caste.
{28}
Sumitra's early life was unusual in the degree to which she lived separated
from one or both of her parents. The separations reflected her father's
efforts
to break out of the life of a village cultivator and become a steady
wageearner.
Because of her parents' movements Sumitra lived for about eight years
with an older cousin, Phool Mala, in the village of Birpur, in the neighboring
district of Mainpuri. Sumitra never attended school, but Phool Mala taught
her the elements of reading and writing. Phool Mala herself had gone to a
primary school only for a year or two, and she had mainly learned to read
and write at home. She taught Sumitra as much as she knew. She said that
Sumitra could read the Ramayana and was able to write a letter. Sumitra's
father told us (incorrectly) that she could not write at all, and her husband
said that she could write "a very little like a child in kindergarten." He
thought that she was (when he knew her) unable to write a letter, but we
learned that she had occasionally done this.
Sumitra's mother, Ganga Devi, died in 1979, when Sumitra was about 1 1.
In childhood Sumitra enjoyed good physical health. When she was about
13 (in 198 l), she was married (in the Indian style of arranged marriages) to
Jagdish Singh and moved to her husband's village of Sharifpura, which is
about 15 km from Angad ka Nagla, where her father was then living.
Sumitra's marriage to a considerable extent repeated the pattern of
separations
that she had experienced in childhood, because her husband, like her father,
went to a city (in his case, Delhi) trying to obtain regular employment, and
he was often away from Sharifpura for months at a time. After three years of
marriage, Sumitra gave birth to a baby boy in December, 1984. A month or
two later, early in 1985, she began to suffer from periods of loss of
consciousness
or trance in which her eyes would roll upwards and she would
clench her teeth. She seemed not to have fallen suddenly in any of these
episodes. The spells lasted varying times-from a few minutes to a whole
day. Sometimes Sumitra would say afterward that Santoshi Ma4 had
possessed
her. On two occasions she was seemingly possessed briefly by discarnate
personalities. One of these communicating personalities said that she
had been a woman of Sharifpura who had drowned herself in a well; the
{29}
other (a male) said that he had been a man of another state in India. She
gave some particulars about this latter life that have not been verified and
are probably unverifiable.
During these episodes of apparent possession, Sumitra's condition
sufficiently
troubled her family so that they consulted local healers. Of these the
most prominent was a man called Vishwa Nath. He was a distant relative of
the family, a cultivator regularly, and without experience in other cases like
Sumitra's. Nevertheless. he seemed to have a pacifying influence on her. He
himself at times went into trances when he would be possessed, as he would
say afterward, by the Hindu god Hanuman.
Vishwa Nath's intervention did not arrest Sumitra's episodes of trance;
and, as we described earlier, she predicted her death, and three days later
(on
July 19, 1985) she lost consciousness and seemed to die. We questioned
several eyewitnesses of this event. Her respiration and pulse stopped and her
face became drained of blood like that of a dead person. A considerable
group of persons surrounding Sumitra were convinced that she had died,
and some began to cry. It was proposed to put her body on the ground (a
Hindu ritual performed for persons who are thought about to die or who
have died). Sumitra seemed to be dead for a period estimated by her
fatherinlaw and brother-in-law as about five minutes. Some other informants
thought that she had been dead for much longer than five minutes before
she revived, but we think they may have estimated the onset of death from a
time when her breathing became shallow and barely perceptible. No doctor
was in or near the village, so Sumitra's heart was not auscultated, and we
have reported the villagers' judgment that Sumitra was dead without
asserting
ourselves that she was.
When Sumitra revived she did not recognize her surroundings including
the people of her husband's family. She said little or nothing for a day after
her revival. Then she began to say that she was Shiva and to describe details
of the life and death of Shiva. We shall summarize her statements about
Shiva's life in a later section of this report, after we describe what we could
learn about Shiva's death.
{30}
Upon hearing Sumitra's statements about Shiva's life and death, her inlaws
thought first that she had gone mad and then that she had become
possessed by a wandering discarnate personality who could be exorcised
away or might leave spontaneously as had the ones previously manifesting
in Sumitra.
In the autumn of 1986 Sumitra became confused for a few hours and
seemed to resume her ordinary personality. Then the Shiva personality
resumed control and was still dominant at the time of our last interviews in
October 1987. By this time the Shiva personality had been dominant-with
the single brief exception just noted-for more than two years.
The Life and Death of Shiva:
Shiva Tripathi was born in Sevpur in the Etawah District on October 24,
1962. Her parents were members of the Brahmin caste and her father, Ram
Siya Tripathi, was a lecturer in a college. After 1965 the family lived in
Etawah, and Shiva grew up there along with five brothers and sisters. She
attended school and then college from which she graduated with a B.A. in
Home Economics.
At the age of 18 and a half she was married to a man called Chhedi Lal,
who lived in the village or small town of Dibiyapur.
Shiva gave birth to two children who became known by the nicknames of
Tinku and Rinku. (Tinku was about 18 months old and Rinku less than 6
months old when Shiva died.) Shiva was living (according to the custom of
joint households in India) in her in-laws' house. Friction developed between
Shiva and her in-laws. It is possible that Shiva's superior education and
more urban manners irritated her in-laws. They grumbled when Shiva
returned
to Etawah in order to write final examinations for her college degree.
Shiva complained that her mother-in-law had told her to go and hang
herself. At one stage her father-in-law wrote to Shiva's father and suggested
that he take her back, but nothing came of this.
A more serious quarrel developed in the second half of May 1985. Shiva
was invited to attend the wedding of a member of her family, and her
in-laws, after at first agreeing to her absence for this function, changed their
minds and forbade her to leave the house. On the evening of May 18, 1985
Shiva's maternal uncle by marriage, Brijesh Pathak, who lived in a village
(Kainjari) about a kilometer from Dibiyapur, called on the family and
{31}
learned from Shiva about the quarrel she had had with her in-laws. Shiva
was crying and told him that her mother-in-law and one of her sisters-in-law
had beaten her. She did not seem depressed, and she did not talk of suicide.
Her uncle tried to calm the family members and advised them to ask Shiva's
father to come and arrange a more durable peace.
The next morning Brijesh Pathak and his brothers learned that Shiva had
died in an "accident." Her dead body had been found on the railway tracks,
and her in-laws said that she had thrown herself in front of a train. We
interviewed five persons who saw Shiva's body on the morning of May 19
before it was cremated. When discovered, it lay between two rails of a track
at the railway station of Phaphoond (which adjoins Dibiyapur). The body
was intact and therefore had not been run over by the wheels of a train;
several trains had passed the station during the night.
Brijesh Pathak, remembering the quarrel between Shiva and her in-laws
of the night before, asked them to delay cremation of the body until he could
go to Etawah and bring Shiva's father (which would take only four hours,
because the railway stations of Dibiyapur and Etawah are both on the main
railway line). However, Shiva's in-laws ignored his pleas, obtained permission
from local authorities to cremate her body,5 and lit the fire at about
11:OO a.m. To make it burn more quickly they had poured fuel oil on
the wood.
Shiva's in-laws said that they had noticed her unexpected absence from
the house and had gone in search of her. Her body had been found on the
railway tracks at the railway station, and they concluded that she had
thrown herself in front of a train. They presented this account of Shiva's
death during judicial inquiries and also in our interviews with them.
Although it is not uncommon for young married women in India who are
harassed by their in-laws to commit suicide, several circumstances in the
death of Shiva pointed away from suicide and raised a suspicion of murder.
First, there was the history of the quarrel on the evening of May 18, when
Shiva had told her uncle that her in-laws had been beating her. Second,
rumors began to circulate in Dibiyapur about persons having seen Shiva's
in-laws carrying her during the night to the railway station at Phaphoond
(just a few hundred meters from their home). They were said to have
explained
that they were taking her to the hospital. Although there were people
around the railway station, it was night, and at one point the lights in the
{32}
station failed; it would then have been dark, so that a dead body might have
been placed on the tracks unobserved. (Firsthand confirmation of this report
would have been of critical importance, but we were unable to learn
even the name of a firsthand informant.) Third, Brijesh Pathak, who saw his
niece's body lying on the platform of the railway station before it was taken
away by her in-laws, remarked that only the head was injured; he thought it
suspicious that a body knocked down by a train was not more extensively
damaged.6 Fourth, although it is customary to have an inquest and autopsy
after any accidental death, the panchnama was signed with suspicious haste,
the expressed wishes of Shiva's uncle to delay the cremation until her father
could arrive were ignored, and the cremation proceeded with hurriedly.
Ram Siya Tripathi arrived at Dibiyapur around 2:00 in the afternoon of
May 19. By that time the cremation fire had reduced his daughter's body to
ashes. After considering all that he could learn about the circumstances of
her death, he complained to the police, and they began a belated inquiry.
Later, he filed a formal charge of murder against Shiva's in-laws. Shiva's
husband and father-in-law were arrested and then released for lack of
evidence.
Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law absconded and remained in
hiding for some months. In 1986 they returned to their home, were arrested,
and then released pending an expected trial. In October 1987 the judicial
inquiry was continuing with the usual delays of such proceedings.
On the facts available to us, we must suspend judgment about how Shiva
died. That she died violently and after a quarrel with her in-laws on the night
of May 1 8- 19, 1985 is established. Her in-laws may have killed her and put
her body on the railway tracks to simulate a suicide; or she may have thrown
herself in front of a train during a trough of depression following the quarrel
with her in-laws.
Sumitra's Statements About the Life and Death of Shiva:
Sumitra's statements made after her revival may be divided into three
groups. The first group consists of names of persons and places that the
newspaper accounts of Shiva's death and her father's lawsuit had published.
We think it extremely unlikely that anyone communicated even the fact of
Shiva's death, to say nothing of its details, to Sumitra or her family. However,
as we have mentioned, some newspapers were circulated in the general
area of Sharifpura, and so we must assume that Sumitra's family might have
{33}
learned about Shiva's death normally. This means we cannot count as
paranormally derived any of the names Sumitra stated that had appeared in
newspaper accounts.
A second group of Sumitra's statements remains unverified. We refer to
her account of Shiva's final quarrel with her in-laws and of how her sisterinlaw had hit her on the head with a brick, after which her body was laid on
the tracks at the railway station to simulate suicide. Nothing refutes these
statements, but they remain unverified and may be wrong.
A third group of statements, those concerned with nicknames and private
affairs not published in the newspapers, includes statements that we think
contain information Sumitra could not have obtained normally. We learned
of 19 items that we felt justified in placing in this, the most important group.
These showed that Sumitra had knowledge of: a particular yellow sari that
Shiva had owned, a watch that had belonged to Shiva and the box (in the
Tripathi home) in which it was kept, the respective order of birth of Shiva's
maternal uncles (although one who was younger actually looked older than
one of the older uncles), one of Shiva's nicknames familiarly used in the
home (Shiv Shanker), the names of two educational institutions where
Shiva had studied (Sarvodya College and Sorawal Intermediate College), the
pet names of Shiva's two children (Rinku and Tinku), the names of two
friends of Shiva who happened to have the same name, and the names of
Shiva's two brothers, two of her sisters, two of her maternal uncles, a
maternal
aunt (by marriage), and a nephew.
Sumitra 's Recognitions of Shiva 's Family Members and Friends:
Observers of recognitions in cases suggestive of reincarnation-of which
the present case may be considered a variant-frequently vitiate them by
asking leading questions or by cueing the subject with glances directed
toward the person to be recognized (Stevenson, 1975, pp. 39-40).
Nevertheless,
there remain several circumstances in which recognitions may occur
that deserve credit as showing paranormal knowledge on the part of the
subject. These are: recognitions that the subject makes spontaneously
without
anyone's having asked him or her to identify another person; recognitions
that occur when the subject is confronted with a person and asked a
{34}
question like: "Do you know who this person is?" or "Tell me who I am";
and recognitions in which the subject immediately afterward adds a
statement
about some intimate detail, perhaps a nickname, not known outside a
small circle of family and friends. We learned of 12 members of Shiva's
family and circle of friends whom Sumitra recognized under conditions that
we believe excluded cueing. We shall describe the circumstances of seven of
Sumitra's recognitions, including one in which cueing might have played a
part and six in which we think it did not.
1. Ram Siya Tripathi, Shiva's father. When he first went to Sharifpura, he
introduced himself outside the house and someone told Sumitra, who
was then inside, that "her father" (that is, Shiva's) had come to the
house. We therefore attach no significance to Sumitra's telling Ram
Siya Tripathi what his name was. However, she called him "Papa" (as
Shiva had) and wept. Also, when Ram Siya Tripathi asked her, Sumitra
immediately stated two pet names by which Shiva was sometimes called
in her family: Aruna and Shiv Shanker. The first of these names, Aruna,
had been published in a newspaper report of Shiva's death, but the
second had not.
2. Baleshwar Prasad Chaturvedi, Shiva's maternal uncle by marriage. Sumitra
recognized him at the time he accompanied Ram Siya Tripathi to
Sharifpura. Asked who he was, Sumitra at first said he was Arvind's
father. (Arvind was one of Shiva's maternal uncles.) Asked to try again,
Sumitra then said that Baleshwar Prasad Chaturvedi was the father of
Arvind's wife. This was correct.
3. Ram Rani, Shiva's mother. This recognition occurred at the time of
Sumitra's first visit to Etawah. Ram Siya tried to mislead Sumitra by
telling her that her (Shiva's) mother was standing in a group of other
women at the Tripathi house. In fact, Ram Rani had gone inside the
house and was not in this group of women. Sumitra insisted that her
(that is, Shiva's) mother was not among the group of other women; she
then went into the house and searched for Shiva's mother whom she
found and embraced tearfully. (Attempts were also made in another
instance to mislead Sumitra deliberately, but failed.) In connection with
this recognition we should note that Ram Siya Tripathi had already
shown Sumitra a photograph of Ram Rani (see below).
4. Ram Naresh, another of Shiva's maternal uncles. This recognition occurred
{35}
at the time of Sumitra's first visit to Etawah. Ram Naresh presented himself
to Sumitra and said: "Who am I?" Sumitra said: "You
are my mother's brother." He said: "Which one?" She replied: "Ram
Naresh of Kanpur." He had formerly lived in Kanpur, and had moved
to Etawah after Shiva's death.
5. Ram Prakash Dixit, another of Shiva's maternal uncles. He went to
Sharifpura (at the end of October, less than 10 days after Ram Siya
Tripathi had first met Sumitra). He had grown a beard, which Shiva had
never seen. When Sumitra first saw him, he was sitting in front of her
and remained silent. She recognized him as Shiva's mother's brother,
but was at first unable to give his name. He then spoke a few words, and
she immediately recognized his voice and stated his name.
6. Manish, Shiva's nephew (the son of her sister Uma). This recognition
occurred in Etawah on November 22, 1985. Sumitra was at the Tripathi
house on an upstairs terrace. One of Shiva's brothers, noticing Uma and
Manish approaching, drew Sumitra's attention to them. Sumitra looked
down and said "Manish has come." Sumitra went down from the terrace,
hugged Uma, and called her "sister." However, this cannot count
as a flawless recognition, because Ram Siya Tripathi had already shown
Sumitra a photograph of Uma (see below).
7. Krishna Devi Dube, a friend of Shiva's youth. This recognition occurred
at Sikandarpur when Sumitra visited her mother-in-law's family,
in February 1986. More than eight years earlier, Krishna Devi and
Shiva had known each other when Shiva used to visit one of her maternal
uncles (Brijesh Pathak) in the village of Kainjari, Krishna Devi's
native place. When Krishna Devi married, she moved to Sikandarpur
and had not met Shiva for more than eight years prior to Shiva's death.
When Sumitra saw Krishna Devi, she said: "Jiji! How come you are
here? I died and have come into a Thakur's family and am helpless."
Shiva would have known normally that Krishna Devi had married and
moved to Sikandarpur; nevertheless, the Shiva personality of Sumitra
-if we may use that expression here-seemed surprised to meet
Krishna Devi in Sikandarpur. Shiva, when alive, had called Krishna
Devi "Jiji." This word means "sister," and although Shiva and Krishna
Devi were not real sisters, close female friends in India may use this
form of address with each other.
In addition to the above mentioned and other recognitions of living persons,
{36}
Sumitra was able to recognize 15 members of Shiva's family in photographs.
When Ram Siya Tripathi first met Sumitra in Sharifpura, he showed
her eight photographs in an album that he had brought. One was of his wife
and children that was taken in 1967, that is, about 18 years earlier. Sumitra
correctly identified all six persons in the photograph: Ram Siya Tripathi, his
wife, his mother, his daughter Uma, his son Raman, and his daughter Shiva.
Of the last, Sumitra said: "This is me."
Shown another photograph, this one of five of the Tripathi children, Sumitra
correctly identified and named all the persons in the photograph.
(Some of these persons figured in the previous photograph and in others
shown to Sumitra.)
Another photograph showed three adult women, two of them holding
infants. Sumitra identified Shiva's mother in it and said the child on her lap
was Shiva's brother Raman. She then said that one of the other women was
a maternal aunt. She said the third woman was possibly another aunt, but
she was unsure of this, and she could not recognize the child on this
woman's lap.
Upon seeing a photograph of Shiva's young son Tinku, Sumitra began to
cry, said the photograph was of Tinku, and asked where Tinku and Rinku
then were.
When a photograph of Shiva's sister-in-law Rama Kanti was shown to
Sumitra, she said: "This is Rama Kanti who hit me with a brick." (Ram Siya
Tripathi said Sumitra's recognition of this photograph dispelled his remaining
doubts about whether his daughter Shiva was possessing her.)
In showing the photographs to Sumitra, Ram Siya Tripathi's attitude
appears to have been one of keen interest mixed with skepticism. He said
that as he showed Sumitra the photographs in the album, he asked her to
identify the persons in them and gave her no cues. She gave the name of
each person and usually the relationship of the person to Shiva. The villager,
La1 Man Dube, who escorted Ram Siya Tripathi and his relative Baleshwar
Prasad Chaturvedi to the house of Sumitra's in-laws in Sharifpura, witnessed
Sumitra's recognitions of the photographs as Ram Siya Tripathi
showed them to her. He confirmed that her recognizing statements about
them were entirely spontaneous and not cued by any remarks the visitors
made. We have described only a portion of the photographs she recognized,
and we have examined the photographs ourselves. Excluding repetitionsof
{37}
the same person appearing in more than one of the photographs-sumitra
was asked to identify 17 persons in the photographs. She unhesitatingly '
identified 12 of them, identified another three after some hesitation, and ~
failed to recognize two persons.
Ram Siya Tripathi showed the album of photographs to Sumitra when he
first met her on October 20, 1985. Although he did not give her cues before
she recognized each photograph, he did tell her after she had finished that
she had recognized all the people in them correctly. We think it likely also
that he communicated to her, if only nonverbally, that she was correct after
her statements about each photograph, if not about each person in a
photograph.
Under these circumstances, Sumitra had some advantage in recognizing
persons she met later in Etawah whose faces she had already seen in
the photographs. (We have referred to two of these persons above, Shiva's
mother and sister.) However, Sumitra was credited with recognizing and
identifying (usually by name) eight members of the family or their circle of
friends, whose photographs she had not seen.
Some of the newspaper accounts of the death of Shiva and of the subsequent
judicial inquiry included photographs of Shiva, but these were taken
in 1979. The photographs of her as a child (which Sumitra recognized) and
the photographs of other members of the Tripathi family had not been
published.
In sum, Sumitra recognized 23 members of Shiva's family and acquaintances
either in person or in photographs, some of them in both ways.
Sumitra's Failure to Recognize People and Places Familiar to Her:
After her revival from apparent death Sumitra could not recognize the
people around her in Sharifpura, such as her husband and her in-laws; they
all seemed complete strangers to her. Similarly, when her father came from
Angad ka Nagla to see her, she did not recognize him. Ordinarily, she would
have greeted him and called him "Father," but instead she said of him: "I do
not know him." She was persuaded to go to Angad ka Nagla, and somewhat
reluctantly agreed to do so. She said that she had no connections there and
no interest in the place. In the village she recognized no one and seemed not
to recognize any of the places with which Sumitra would have been familiar.
Similarly, when Phool Mala, Sumitra's older cousin who had in effect
{38}
raised her from the age of five, went to see her in Sharifpura, she did not
recognize her; nor did she recognize Phool Mala's husband, Risal Singh.
Sumitra, after her revival, showed no interest in her husband and child.
She refused her husband's amatory advances for some time and did not
acknowledge that her child was hers. Instead, she asked about Shiva's two
children. Over a period of some days and weeks, she gradually came to
accept her husband and son and to respond appropriately to them. Of her
child she said (while still insisting that she was Shiva, not Sumitra): "If I look
after this child [meaning Sumitra's son] God will take care of them [meaning
Shiva's children]. If I neglect this child, would God not punish me?"
Under this heading we may mention also Sumitra's disorientation for
place. For example, when her mother-in-law took her out to the fields for
natural functions-the usual site for these in Indian villages-she seemed
nonplussed and asked what they were doing in the fields. When her
mother-in-law explained, she said: "We have a latrine inside the house
[meaning in Etawah and Dibiyapur]." This was correct for both the house of
Shiva's parents and that of her in-laws.
Sumitra's Changed Behavior After Reviving
We have already described Sumitra's initial failure (after her revival) to
recognize the people around her in Sharifpura, and how, after neglecting her
husband and child, she gradually resumed more or less normal relations
with them. However, she said that her son was Jagdish Singh's child from his
first marriage. Her attitude toward members of the family of her in-laws was
that they were good people and, as she was thrust among them, she would
be
as gracious about the necessary adjustment as she could be. Nevertheless,
there remained important differences in her behavior compared with that
before her apparent death and revival. We shall now describe some of these
changed behaviors.
Sumitra 's Different Identification of Herself and Modes of Addressing Other
Persons: Sumitra obstinately insisted that she was Shiva and sometimes
would not respond or carry out a request unless she was called Shiva. She
addressed her husband, Jagdish Singh, as "Thakur Sahib," showing respect,
but distance. Previously she had called him (with the indirection Indian
wives commonly use) "Guddi's brother." (Guddi was Jagdish's sister.)
Formerly
{39}
Sumitra had called her father-in-law by a Hindi word "chacha,"
meaning an uncle; now she called him "Father." Formerly she had called
her mother-in-law by a word, "Amma," for mother; now she addressed her
by another, more respectful word for mother, "Mataji."
In the month following Sumitra's apparent death and revival, a particularly
poignant episode occurred. At that season (August) it is customary in
northern India for women to show their loyalty to their brothers by tying a
short length of string around a brother's wrist. This is known as the rakhi
ceremony, and Hindus attach great importance to it. When Sumitra's
brother came to Sharifpura and asked her to return with him to Angad ka
Nagla for the rakhi ceremony, she refused saying she knew no one at Angad
ka Nagla. The brother began weeping and begged her to tie the rakhi string
on him. She still refused and began to weep herself saying that she had no
brothers near her to whom she could tie the rakhi string. (We have our
account of this episode only from Sumitra and have not learned about it
from Sumitra's family.)
Different Style of Dress: Sumitra changed her style of dress. She wore her sari
in a different manner and put on sandals, which Sumitra, like most village
women, had rarely worn. Her new habits of dressing accorded with
Shiva's style.
Caste Snobbery: After her revival Sumitra showed, for a time, a definite
hauteur toward her in-laws, the Singhs. Thinking of herself as Shiva, a
Brahmin, she regarded them, Thakurs, as inferior.
On the occasion of Sumitra's first journey to Etawah with Shiva's father,
Ram Siya Tripathi, and her husband, Jagdish Singh, the group stopped at
the home of Baleshwar Prasad Chaturvedi in the village of Umrain. After
they had eaten a meal, Sumitra told Jagdish Singh: "Please wash the plates
and utensils you used. You are a Thakur and they are Brahmins. It does not
matter for me [meaning about her plates and utensils], because I am one
of them."
Sumitra's Increased Literacy: Sumitra could read a little, and she was able
to write letters and occasionally did so. However, the testimony of
informants was concordant that she had never attended school and had
attained
{40}
only a very limited knowledge of reading and writing. After her revival she
showed a marked improvement in her ability to read and write. We observed
her in both of these activities and found her able to read and write
Hindi with great facility. However, we wish to emphasize that the significant
change in Sumitra's literacy was not in her basic ability to read and write but
in her fluency in these activities and in her interest in writing. Whereas
formerly she only wrote a letter occasionally, after the change in her
personality
she wrote letters and postcards often to Shiva's family in Etawah.
Other Unusual Behavior: Ram Siya Tripathi said that he noticed in Sumitra
some behavior that he regarded as characteristic of Shiva, such as a certain
boldness and a tendency to joke. Her husband said that Sumitra, before her
apparent death and revival, would usually get up at about 6:00 a.m.; after
her death and revival she got up much earlier, at about 4:00 a.m. Shiva had
been an early riser; her father said that she used to get up at 5:00 to 5:30
a.m.
and even earlier in the summers. One of her uncles commented to us that
Shiva used to go to bed earlier and get up earlier than other members of the
family. However, we recognize that traits such as we have mentioned in this
section are difficult to appraise, and we think they are less important than
the others we have mentioned.
Discussion:
We propose to discuss what we believe are the four principal interpretations
of the case: fraud; cryptomnesia (source amnesia) with secondary
personality; secondary personality having paranormal knowledge; and
possession
of Sumitra's body by the deceased Shiva.
Fraud:
We think we can exclude a hoax perpetrated by Sumitra alone. A barely
literate village woman in India could not have obtained detailed accurate
information about another woman who lived 100 km away without
assistance.
If there was a hoaxing team, who composed it? Sumitra's husband, as
a man, could move around more easily than Sumitra, but he was not in a
{41}
position to go to places like Dibiyapur and Etawah in order to search out
unpublished details about the life of Shiva. It has been suggested that the
exorcist Vishwa Nath, who had access to Sumitra (although probably never
alone) before and after her apparent death and recovery, might have
obtained
information about Shiva and coached Sumitra with the details of
which he had knowledge. However, this suggestion also, in our view, fails to
take account of the information Sumitra had of the private life of the Tripathi
family, and it fails to explain her ability to recognize 23 strange persons
in person or in photographs.
Shiva's in-laws at Dibiyapur had all the information included in Sumitra's
statements about Shiva's life and death, but they were already incriminated
in Shiva's death and had an interest, therefore, in Sumitra's silence. Sumitra's
"Shiva personality" was saying publicly that Shiva's in-laws had murdered
her, and the in-laws could not be suspected of promoting this view of
Shiva's death.
Shiva's parental family also had the information included in Sumitra's
statements. Ram Siya Tripathi might have collaborated in a hoax. In talking
with us, he himself mentioned this possibility. When we asked him whether
he thought Sumitra might have learned normally about Shiva he said: "No.
If she had done that how could she recognize me and members of my
family?'Then he spontaneously added: "People say I have made this case
up, but why would I do that? I am gaining nothing, and my [legal] case
[against Shiva's in-laws] will not be improved. Sumitra cannot be a witness.
I am not getting my daughter back." We think he is correct on these points.
Sumitra and her in-laws might have gained a little status from the change
in her behavior and from the social elevation of a "new" family member
from the Thakur caste to the Brahmin one. In addition, her husband, who
had been away a lot prior to the change, was staying at home more than he
had before and presumably giving her more attention. However, all these
possible gains seem to us minuscule.
Cryptomnesia:
The interpretation of cryptomnesia with secondary personality suggests
that Sumitra somehow obtained information about Shiva's life normally
without being aware that she had done so and also without her family being
{42}
aware of this. She would then have used the information in the construction
of a secondary personality (Stevenson, 1983b). As mentioned, information
published in the newspapers about Shiva's death may have reached persons
in Sharifpura, even though we found no evidence that it had. The next steps
are, however, difficult to imagine. How could the published informationand
much else besides-have been passed on to Sumitra without others
being aware that this had happened? Moreover, how could information in a
verbal form have enabled Sumitra to recognize many members of Shiva's
family in person and in old photographs? Such recognitions depend on tacit
knowing that cannot be conveyed in words (Polanyi, 1966).'
Apart from the newspapers there were the traders who went between
Sharifpura and Etawah and the women of the neighboring village of Murra
who were married in Dibiyapur or nearby. The latter group particularly
drew our attention. If one or two of them had brought the news of Sumitra's
death, revival, and changed personality to Dibiyapur, could they not also
have been conduits for information from Dibiyapur about Shiva's death and
other details of her life? We spent considerable time both at Dibiyapur and
Murra in probing for ways in which this might have happened, and we
cannot see any way in which it could. Although Murra and Sharifpura are
only 2 km apart by road (and closer across the fields), there is little
intercourse
between the villages except on special occasions. Because they are so
close, they are considered twin villages and each is inside the other's
boundaries
for acceptable exogamy; therefore, there are no marriages between the
two villages. At the same time, the villages are far enough apart so that the
inhabitants of one do not meet those of the other when they are at work in
their fields. One informant of Sharifpura, who lived less than 60 m from
Sumitra's house (and was distantly related to her), assured us that it would
have been "impossible" for women of Murra to have told or taught Sumitra
what she knew about Shiva's family. Again, even supposing that the women
of Murra had brought back and somehow conveyed to Sharifpura some
news of Shiva's death, such knowledge as they may have had would not have
accounted for all of Sumitra's knowledge of Shiva's private life and for her
ability to recognize so many persons known to Shiva, but whom Sumitra
had never seen before.
{43}
Secondary Personality With Paranormal Knowledge:
Most secondary personalities do not demonstrate paranormal knowledge;*
but a few exceptions have occurred, and the case of Doris Fischer
(Prince, 19 15- 19 16, 1926) belongs in this small group. There is no evidence
that Sumitra had any powers of extrasensory perception before her apparent
death and revival. However, if she somehow acquired such powers she
might conceivably have obtained information paranormally about the life
and death of Shiva and then developed a secondary personality with that
information. The sudden enhancement of Sumitra's ability to read and
write makes the case parallel to that of Pearl Curran; she was a person of
extremely modest education whose secondary personality, "Patience
Worth," wrote a series of remarkable historical novels that seemed far
beyond the normal capacities of Mrs. Curran (Litvag, 1972; Prince, 1927).
However, "Patience Worth" showed little evidence of telepathy and certainly
nothing like what Sumitra demonstrated, if we attribute her knowledge
of details of Shiva's life to that process.
Possession:
The evidence that Sumitra's case provides of paranormally acquired
information
invites comparison between it and the cases of Lurancy Vennum
(Hodgson, 190 1 ; Stevens, 1 887) and Maria Talarico (Giovetti, 1985;
Scambio,
1939). However, these were cases in which the change of personality
was so marked that the term possession seemed applicable to them. And this
is the fourth interpretation we wish considered for the present case.
If the other interpretations we have mentioned should be set aside as
inadequately accounting for all the facts of the case, we are led to consider
that a drastic change of personality occurred. When personality becomes
altered unrecognizably, taking on the attributes and the knowledge a
deceased
personality was known to have, it may be best to speak of the change
as a type of possession or reincarnation. Although we do not dogmatically
assert that this is the correct interpretation of this case, we believe much of
the evidence makes it the most plausible one…

Report 2:
Shiva sumitra rebirth case 2:
The Shiva-Sumitra reincarnation case is a fascinating and unusual
phenomenon that has been investigated by multiple researchers. Let's delve
into the details:
1. Shiva Tripathi:
- Shiva Tripathi was born on October 24, 1962, into a Brahmin family in
India.
- She grew up in the city of Etawah and obtained a BA in home economics.
- Shiva entered into an arranged marriage and faced animosity from her inlaws due to her education and urban manners.
- Tragically, in late May 1985, Shiva's in-laws forbade her from attending an
exam or a family wedding. The next morning, her body was found on railway
tracks, with severe head injuries. Her in-laws claimed she had thrown herself
in front of a train¹.
2. Sumitra Singh's Transformation:
- Sumitra Singh, from the same district, appeared to die and then revived.
- She lost awareness of her former personality but exhibited the
knowledge, behaviors, and personality traits of Shiva Tripathi.
- Sumitra accurately recognized Shiva's family members and related to
them appropriately.
- The Tripathi family accepted Sumitra as Shiva in a different body, and she
retained this new identity for the rest of her life.
- Researchers have interpreted this case variously as one of reincarnation,
possession, or both¹.
3. Intermission Period:
- The intermission period refers to the time between Shiva's death and
Sumitra's revival.
- In this case, the intermission period was approximately two months. Shiva
Tripathi died on May 18, 1985, and Sumitra died and was revived with Shiva's
personality on July 19, 1985.
- During this time, Sumitra transitioned from her former self to embodying
Shiva's personality and memories¹.
{45}
Shiva was murdered by her in-laws. The intermission period between
Shiva’s death and Sumitra's death and Sumitra’s return as Shiva was very
brief. Shiva Tripathi died on May 18, 1985, and Sumitra died and was revived
with Shiva's personality on July 19, 1985. This makes the intermission period
about 2 months.
During this period, Shiva reported having a vivid experience in the afterlife.
She described being killed and then finding herself in a hellish realm where
she encountered Yama, the ruler of hell. In this realm, she witnessed sinful
people being punished by monstrous beings. However, due to her some good
karma, Yama offered her a chance to return to human life, leading to her
reincarnation in Sumitra's body.
4. Verified Statements and Recognitions:
- Sumitra made accurate recognitions of Shiva's family members,
demonstrating her connection to Shiva's life.
- The transformation was so profound that Sumitra's new identity persisted
until the end of her life¹.
5. Possession, Reincarnation, or Both?:
- Researchers have grappled with the nature of this case.
- Was it a form of possession, where Sumitra embodied Shiva's
consciousness?
- Or was it a genuine reincarnation, where Shiva's soul inhabited Sumitra's
body?
- The answer remains elusive, and this case challenges our understanding
of consciousness and identity¹.
In summary, the Shiva-Sumitra case exemplifies the mysterious interplay
between life, death, and identity, leaving us with more questions than
answers¹.

Report 3
Sumitra Shiva replacement reincarnation case details:
In 1985, a young married woman named Sumitra Singh from a village in
northern India appeared to die and then revived. After a period of confusion,
she stated that she was Shiva, a woman who had been murdered by her inlaws in another village two months earlier. Sumitra was able to accurately
recognize Shiva's family members and relate to them in the appropriate
customary manner. Shiva's family accepted Sumitra as Shiva in a different
body, and she retained this new identity for the rest of her life. This highly
unusual case was investigated by multiple researchers and has been
interpreted variously as one of reincarnation, possession, or both.
Shiva Tripathi was born on October 24, 1962, in Sevpur in the Etawah District
of India. She was a member of the Brahmin caste, and her father, Ram Siya
Tripathi, was a lecturer in a college. Shiva grew up in Etawah and attended
school and college, graduating with a B.A. in Home Economics. At the age of
18 and a half, she was married to a man named Chhedi Lal, who lived in the
village of Dibiyapur. Shiva had two children, nicknamed Tinku and Rinku, and
lived in her in-laws' house.
Friction developed between Shiva and her in-laws, who were irritated by her
education and manners or considered her dowry insufficient. A serious
quarrel occurred in May 1985, when Shiva was forbidden to attend a family
wedding. On the evening of May 18, Shiva's maternal uncle by marriage,
Brijesh Pathak, visited the family and learned of the quarrel. Shiva was crying
{47}
and told him that her mother-in-law and one of her sisters-in-law had beaten
her. The next morning, Shiva's body was found on the railway tracks at the
nearby station of Phaphoond. Her in-laws said that she had thrown herself in
front of a train, but there were rumors that they had murdered her.
Sumitra Singh was born around 1968 in Angad ka Nagla in the Etawah
District. She was a member of the Thakur caste, one level below the
Brahmins. Sumitra never attended school but was taught rudimentary
reading and writing by a cousin who had attended school only for a year or
two. When Sumitra was 13, she was married to Jagdish Singh of the village of
Sharifpura, and she moved in with his family. After three years of marriage,
she gave birth to a boy in December 1984.
In early 1985, Sumitra began to have episodes of loss of consciousness, in
which her eyes would roll upward and she would clench her teeth. These
episodes varied in duration from a few minutes to a full day. Sometimes she
would say afterward that she had been possessed by the goddess Santoshi
Mata, of whom she was a devotee. On two occasions, she was briefly
possessed by communicating personalities, one a woman who had drowned
herself in a well and the other a man from another part of India. Sumitra's
family sought the aid of local healers, to no avail.
On July 19, 1985, Sumitra predicted that she would die three days later. That
same day, she lost consciousness and appeared to die. Eyewitnesses agreed
that her respiration and pulse stopped, and her face drained of blood for at
least five minutes. But as her family members began mourning her, she came
back to life. Her identity appeared to have completely changed; she now
called herself Shiva Tripathi.
The case was first investigated by reincarnation scientist Ian Stevenson and
Satwant Pasricha independently, having been brought to their attention in
October 1985 when each was sent a newspaper article about it. They
interviewed witnesses and members of Shiva's and Sumitra's families and
also studied newspaper reports of Shiva's death and the murder allegation.
They also viewed photos of Shiva's family members whom Sumitra had
correctly identified. Psychologist Parmeshwar Dayal carried out a concurrent
investigation and presented it at a conference in March 1987. He interviewed
{48}
Sumitra and the families and had people who knew Sumitra well complete a
psychological questionnaire. He also performed a Rorschach test on Sumitra
and had a handwriting analysis done on three letters, two written by Shiva
and another said to have been written by Sumitra following her
transformation.
Two later attempts at follow-up investigations were made, but Sumitra and
her husband could not be contacted. In 2009, Antonia Mills and Kuldip
Dhiman learned from the Singh family in Sharifpur that Sumitra had died in
1998 and Jagdish in 2008. They obtained two previously unpublished letters
written by Shiva and Sumitra after her changeover and interviewed Shiva's
parents, sister, brother, and other relatives, Shiva's husband, son, and
mother-in-law, and Sumitra's brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and other
associates. The purpose of this follow-up investigation was to reassess the
case, learn whether Sumitra had continued to identify as Shiva, and compare
the case with other cases of possession and reincarnation.
When Sumitra awakened, she did not recognize her surroundings or the
people around her. She spoke very little for a day and then began saying that
her name was Shiva and that she had been murdered by her in-laws in
Dibiyapur. She wanted nothing to do with Sumitra's husband and infant son
but wanted to be taken to see Shiva's two children. She stated many details
about Shiva and her life that the researchers learned from relatives who had
been witness to the statements.
Sumitra's family thought she had gone insane or was possessed, so they
made no attempt to verify the stated facts. Because she was deemed
possessed, she was "cruelly tortured continuously for a long period by Ohjas
(exorcists or spirit healers) for redemption and cure." But she remained in
the Shiva persona.
Shiva Tripathi was murdered by her in-laws on May 18, 1985. Two months
later, on July 19, Sumitra Singh died and was revived with Shiva's personality.
During the intermission period between her death and rebirth, Shiva had a
vivid experience in the afterlife. She found herself in a hellish realm ruled by
lord Yama, where she witnessed sinners being punished by monstrous
beings. However, due to her some good karma, Yama offered her the chance
{49}
to return to human life, resulting in her reincarnation in Sumitra's body. After
being awakened in Sumitra's body, Shiva claimed to have memories from the
intermission period. She said that she was brought before god Yama and saw
people with their feet turned backward, being punished according to their
karma. The goddess Santoshi Mata helped her by hiding her under Yama's
seat and feeding her. After several days, Sumitra begged Yama for mercy, and
he agreed to send her back for seven more years of life.
Stevenson and his colleagues were careful to ascertain that the two families
had not been in contact before these events. Dibiyapur and Sharifpura are
about 60 miles apart, and the families were of different castes and
educational levels and followed very different lifestyles, one urban and
professional and the other rural and agricultural. They also compared
Sumitra's statements with the newspaper reports to identify information that
was not contained in them. They counted 19 correct statements from
Sumitra that were not given in any newspaper report, showing apparent
paranormal knowledge of Shiva's life and possessions.
Shiva's father, Ram Siya Tripathi, heard a rumor that his deceased daughter
had possessed a girl in Sharifpura. He visited Sumitra on October 20, 1985,
and showed her some pictures in a photograph album. She correctly
identified all six family members in a photograph taken 18 years earlier, five
of the Tripathi children in another picture, and Shiva's mother, brother, and
maternal aunt in a third. Upon seeing a photo of Shiva's young son Tinku,
Sumitra began to cry and asked where Tinku and Rinku were. Upon seeing a
photo of Shiva's sister-in-law, she said, "this is Rama Kanti, who hit me with a
brick." This statement convinced Tripathi that Sumitra was his daughter
returned. Of 17 people in eight photographs, she identified 12 without
hesitation and three with some hesitation, failing to recognize only two.
Sumitra recognized 23 of Shiva's relatives and friends either in person, in
photographs, or both. She was no longer able to recognize people in her own
family, including her husband, nine-month-old son, in-laws, father, cousin,
and cousin's husband. She was also confused about places, commenting that
her family had a latrine inside the house, which was true of both homes in
which Shiva had lived.
{50}
Sumitra's behaviors changed markedly after her transformation, being
appropriate to a high-caste, educated woman. She now wore her sari in a
more dignified way and wore sandals instead of going barefoot. She also
became an early riser, as Shiva had been. Sumitra now refused to respond
unless she was addressed as Shiva. She also became more formal in the way
she addressed other people, including her husband and his parents. On the
grounds of her higher caste, she behaved snobbishly towards her in-laws,
even asking her husband to wash his plates and utensils while they were
visiting a Brahmin home, since he was of a lower caste. She refused to
participate in an important Hindu ritual in which a sister ties a string around
her brother's wrist, despite her brother begging her to do so.
Sumitra refused at first to be intimate with her husband or acknowledge her
baby son, claiming he was a product of Jagdish's previous marriage. However,
she eventually accepted the roles of wife and mother while still insisting she
was Shiva.
Prior to her transformation, Sumitra's level of literacy was rudimentary. She
had never attended school and was taught only a little reading and writing by
a cousin who herself had only one year of primary schooling. In contrast,
Shiva had written frequently to her birth family following her marriage. After
the transformation, Sumitra's ability to read and write improved strikingly.
She was observed to be able to read and write Hindi with great facility, and
her letter-writing became frequent. She often wrote to the Tripathi family,
just as Shiva had.
During Mills's and Dhiman's investigation, they obtained five letters, two
previously unpublished, written by Shiva and Sumitra after her
transformation. In her letters to her parents following her marriage, Shiva
wrote frequently that she missed them and expressed concerns about not
having enough time to visit or write them or study for her B.A. She also asked
to be kept posted on how her sister and friends were doing in their studies
and shared news. The latest-dated letter, written five months before her
death, reveals distress: "Every night I get scared in my dreams and sometimes
I wake up screaming."
{51}
Sumitra's letter was written to Tripathi about five months after she
reawakened as Shiva. The handwriting is hurried, less tidy, and with far more
words crossed out. The tone is desperate, with Sumitra writing repeatedly
that she doesn't like it here, pleading to be taken away, avowing that she is
indeed Shiva, and even writing, "God is bad as he has dumped me here."
Dhiman assessed the writing ability of Sumitra in this letter as at least Grade
10.
Mills and Dhiman note that the way Sumitra signed her letter and the
expressed sentiments of missing her family bear similarities to Shiva's letterwriting habits and style.
In Ian Stevenson's assessment, although Sumitra's level of literacy had
increased significantly, it still fell somewhat short of Shiva's. He compared the
situation to "a master pianist sitting down to play a broken-down piano. It
wouldn't sound the same as a highly-tuned piano. You have to allow for the
new instrument."
Sumitra's family members in Sharifpur all reported that she remained "Shiva"
to the end of her life, a period of 13 years. According to Jagdish Singh's
younger brother Arjun, their mother "did feel odd about it, but later she got
used to it."
For their part, Tripathi family members concurred that Sumitra had retained
the persona of Shiva as long as they retained contact with her, up until 1988,
and that it was somewhat hard for them. Three of Shiva's siblings all said
independently, "You see the body, not the soul." Her sister Uma added that
Sumitra "loved me the same way... only the face was different."
Ram Siya Tripathi recalled that Shiva had told him she was saddened to find
herself in a strange body. She would point to a blemish on her foot and some
marks on her face and tell him that these marks remind her that "this body is
not mine." At first, the Tripathis welcomed Sumitra and Jagdish into the
family, finding Jagdish a job in Etawah. But due partly to the social stigma of a
man living with his wife's parents and partly to Jagdish's difficulty retaining
employment, the couple returned to Sharifpur, and the Tripathis slowly
distanced themselves from them. They were not aware that Sumitra had
{52}
passed away until Dhiman told them, and they were saddened at the loss of
their "dharma daughter," that is, she who had returned due to cosmic justice.
During a visit to Dibiyapur, Mills and Dhiman learned that Shiva's sons Tinku
and Rinku, now in their teens, had no memory of their mother. Rinku was
being raised by his paternal aunt, the person suspected of killing Shiva.
The case of Sumitra raises questions about the nature of possession and
reincarnation. Journalist Tom Shroder remarked that, while subjects in other
cases investigated by Stevenson seemed entirely sane, "with Sumitra, you
had something that looked almost like multiple-personality disorder." He was
particularly puzzled about the episode in which "Shiva," occupying the body
of Sumitra, gave way for a short time to the original "Sumitra." How could
this be, if Sumitra had in fact died?
Stevenson created a typology of possession and reincarnation, ranging from
partial temporary possession to complete temporary possession to complete
permanent possession after birth to reincarnation. Of course, he could not be
certain whether Sumitra's experiencing of herself as Shiva would turn out to
be temporary or permanent until she died; only when Mills and Dhiman
confirmed her death could the condition be considered permanent.
Reincarnation researcher James Matlock coined the term "replacement
reincarnation" for cases in which one spirit replaces another permanently
without the body dying, such as Sumitra's. Matlock notes that the
replacement usually happens after an (often severe) illness and that only two
age ranges have been observed so far: up to age three, most commonly, and
more rarely, as with Sumitra, in the teen years.
Mills and Dhiman examined Sumitra's case in the context both of possession
cases and reincarnation cases. They note that the duration of a possession
can last from a short time to many years, so that for Sumitra to have
experienced herself as Shiva for 13 years is not implausible. They observe
that while typical reincarnation cases often feature birthmarks or birth
defects that echo wounds or injuries sustained by the previous person, this
tends not to happen with possession cases, presumably because the body is
{53}
already formed. Following her transformation, Sumitra showed no birthmark
reminiscent of the fatal wound to Shiva's head.
The super-psi hypothesis can also be invoked in cases of the reincarnationpossession type. Philosopher Stephen Braude suggests it may apply in the
Shiva-Sumitra case. For instance, he points out that every time Sumitra was
asked if she recognized a person, someone was present who knew the
answer, making telepathic transfer among the living a plausible alternative to
reincarnation or possession. But in that case, what would the underlying
motivation have been? Braude suggests that Sumitra might have constructed
the Shiva personality psychically to achieve one or both of two possible
objectives: a promotion in caste and/or increased attention from her
husband, which she presumably yearned for after a childhood history of
frequent abandonment, especially by male figures.
Braude also questions why, if Sumitra was genuinely Shiva, she did not move
back in with her birth family and continue her relationship with her two
infant sons. As for her increased literacy, he argues this can be explained by
"latent faculties" that have been observed to emerge in cases of dissociative
identity disorder.
However, Braude concedes that the consistency of Sumitra's ability to
recognize individuals known to Shiva exceeds that of the best psychics. He
also points to the "crippling complexity" that tends to weaken the force of
super-psi as an explanation.
Responding to earlier statements by Braude of these ideas, Mills and Dhiman
argue that evidence in reincarnation and possession cases convinces not just
in terms of abilities or knowledge of facts but "the full embodiment and
enactment of personality characteristics." It was this, they contend, that
persuaded Shiva's relatives that Sumitra had indeed become Shiva. They also
point out that Sumitra demonstrated no psychic ability, in contrast to
mediums, who can apparently psychically contact any number of beings both
living and dead. Furthermore, even though she had experienced short-term
possessions by other spirits, she remained Shiva, never becoming Sumitra
again except momentarily. They conclude that the case is "one of the
strongest indicating that survival after bodily death can occur."
{54}
But as Shroder points out, it remains mysterious that Sumitra's original
persona reappeared for a short time two years after Shiva's emergence, just
once. Did she return and reclaim her body momentarily? Did her soul remain
in the body, latent, and only come out at that time? The truth may never be
known…
Choosing Our Social Circles Wisely: The
First Lesson.
In the labyrinth of life, our social circles act as both guides and mirrors,
shaping our perspectives, choices, and destinies. One of the most profound
lessons the journey offers is the importance of not associating with
unintelligent, foolish individuals. Whether termed as "unwise," "stupid," or
simply "fools," the ramifications of such associations extend far beyond mere
inconvenience. They touch the very core of our personal growth, well-being,
and moral fiber. Associating closely with unintelligent or foolish individuals
can indeed contribute to our decline in various aspects. Here's why:
1. Influence and Environment:
The adage "birds of a feather flock together" holds true in the realm of
human relationships. Our social environments significantly influence our
thoughts, behaviors, and attitudes. Associating with individuals lacking
intelligence or wisdom exposes us to negative influences, fostering
unproductive habits or attitudes that hinder our progress.
{55}
2. Intellectual Stagnation:
Like stagnant water breeds mosquitoes, associating with unintelligent or
foolish individuals can breed intellectual stagnation. Meaningful discourse
and interactions with wise minds stimulate critical thinking and foster
intellectual growth. Conversely, spending time with those lacking in
intelligence or wisdom hampers our intellectual development, leading to
stagnation.
3. Emotional Well-being:
Our emotional well-being is intricately linked to the quality of our
relationships. Interacting with individuals exhibiting foolish or unwise
behaviors can be emotionally draining and detrimental to our mental health.
Negative attitudes, drama, and irresponsibility create stress and conflict,
corroding our emotional well-being over time.
4. Values and Morality:
Our associations shape our ethical compass. Associating with individuals
lacking wisdom or discernment may compromise our values or moral
principles. Surrounding ourselves with morally upright and wise individuals
reinforces ethical behavior and promotes personal integrity, anchoring us in
our principles.
5. Productivity and Success:
Success leaves clues, and wise individuals often hold the keys to unlock doors
to achievement. Associating with intelligent and wise individuals provides
valuable insights, advice, and guidance that fuel personal and professional
success. Their wisdom inspires motivation, goal-setting, and the pursuit of
excellence.
6. Self-Reflection and Growth:
In the crucible of meaningful relationships, we forge our identities and
aspirations. Interacting with individuals possessing intelligence and wisdom
offers fertile ground for self-reflection and growth. Constructive feedback,
meaningful conversations, and differing perspectives expand our horizons
and propel us towards personal development.
7. Energy Drain:
{56}
Every interaction saps or replenishes our energy. Associating with
unintelligent or foolish individuals drains our energy and enthusiasm. Dealing
with irrationality, illogical thinking, or negativity exhausts us, diverting our
focus from more meaningful pursuits.
8. Risk of Misguidance:
Perhaps the gravest risk lies in being led astray by misguided beliefs or
actions. Foolish individuals may unwittingly propagate misinformation or
engage in reckless behaviors. Close association with unintelligent or foolish
individuals increases the risk of being influenced by their misguided actions
or beliefs. This proximity carries significant risks of misguidance, including
susceptibility to misinformation, poor decision-making, potential ethical
compromises, financial and legal jeopardy, damage to reputation, and
hindrance to personal growth. Vulnerability to adopting erroneous beliefs,
engaging in unethical behavior, and making unwise financial decisions is
heightened in such associations. To mitigate these risks, exercising
discernment in social connections, prioritizing relationships with intelligent
and ethical individuals, and seeking guidance from trusted mentors are
crucial strategies.
9. Quality of Relationships:
Meaningful connections thrive on mutual respect, understanding, and shared
values. Associations with unintelligent or foolish individuals may hinder the
development of deep, meaningful connections, as intellectual stimulation
and common ground are lacking.
10. Cultivating a Positive Environment:
Our social ecosystems either nourish or poison our growth. Surrounding
ourselves with intelligent or wise individuals fosters a positive, supportive
environment conducive to personal and collective success. Such
environments nurture mutual encouragement, constructive feedback, and a
shared commitment to growth and excellence.
Education is a valuable asset that can contribute to intelligence or wisdom,
but it does not guarantee them. Intelligence refers to the ability to acquire
and apply knowledge and skills effectively, while wisdom encompasses
broader aspects such as insight, judgment, and understanding gained
{57}
through experience, reflection, and critical thinking. While education can
certainly enhance one's intelligence and provide a foundation for wisdom,
these qualities are not exclusively tied to formal education.
Indeed, there can be educated individuals who lack intelligence or wisdom,
commonly referred to as "educated fools." These individuals may have
acquired academic credentials or knowledge in a specific field but may
demonstrate poor judgment, lack critical thinking skills, believe only what
their eyes can see or make unwise decisions in other aspects of their lives.
Education alone does not guarantee sound judgment, ethical behavior, or
emotional intelligence, which are crucial components of wisdom.
Conversely, there are individuals who may not have received formal
education but demonstrate high levels of intelligence or wisdom. They may
possess innate cognitive abilities, critical thinking skills, emotional
intelligence, and a deep understanding of true nature, acquired through life
experiences, self-reflection, and continuous learning, etc.
While education can contribute to intelligence and provide a foundation for
wisdom, they are distinct concepts that encompass a range of qualities
beyond academic knowledge. Intelligence and wisdom can be found in
individuals regardless of their educational background, and it is possible for
educated individuals to lack these qualities, just as it is possible for
uneducated individuals to possess them.
Intelligence involves more than just the accumulation of knowledge; it
encompasses the astute utilization of that knowledge, considering factors like
providence and the natural laws governing the world. Furthermore,
intelligence is demonstrated through the adept application of acquired
knowledge to attain favorable outcomes.
In summary, associating closely with unintelligent or foolish individuals can
have detrimental effects on various aspects of our lives. It not only limits our
perspectives by exposing us to a narrow range of ideas but also hinders our
ability to adapt and grow. Their negative influence, characterized by
pessimism or irresponsibility, can gradually erode our mindset and habits,
leading to a decline in our overall outlook. Furthermore, this association may
{58}
stagnate our growth by depriving us of intellectually stimulating
conversations and learning opportunities. Additionally, aligning with such
individuals increases the risk of making regrettable decisions and undermines
our confidence and self-esteem over time. Therefore, prioritizing
relationships with intelligent, wise, and ethical individuals is crucial for
mitigating these risks and fostering an environment conducive to our
continued growth, success, and well-being. In essence, our social circles
profoundly impact our lives, and choosing to associate with positive
influences aligns with the pursuit of personal growth, well-being, and ethical
conduct. Cultivating supportive relationships with intelligent and discerning
individuals ensures our journey through life is marked by wisdom and
purpose…
Unanswered Questions and Challenges of
the Big Bang Theory.
The Big Bang Theory is a cornerstone of modern cosmology. It is a widely
accepted scientific model that describes the universe's expansion from a very
high-density and high-temperature state, approximately 13.8 billion years
ago. The theory has been remarkably successful in explaining a wide range of
observations, including the large-scale structure of the universe, the
abundance of light elements, and the cosmic microwave background
radiation. However, like any scientific theory, the Big Bang Theory is not
without its challenges and unanswered questions. Here, we explore some of
these issues.
1. The Singularity Problem:
{59}
At the heart of the Big Bang Theory is the concept of a singularity - an
infinitely small and dense point from which the universe is thought to have
originated. However, our current understanding of physics breaks down
when dealing with singularities. The laws of physics that govern the behavior
of matter and energy at large scales (general relativity) and small scales
(quantum mechanics) are incompatible with each other, making it difficult to
understand what exactly happened at the moment of the Big Bang.
2. The Horizon Problem:
One of the most puzzling aspects of the Big Bang Theory is the horizon
problem. This problem arises from the observation that different parts of the
universe appear to have the same temperature and other properties, even
though they are so far apart that they couldn't have interacted or influenced
each other since the Big Bang. This suggests that some mechanism must have
existed in the early universe to coordinate the properties of these distant
regions.
3. The Flatness Problem:
Another challenge to the Big Bang Theory is the flatness problem. This refers
to the fact that the universe appears to be "flat" (in terms of its geometry),
rather than curved. A flat universe is a very precise condition that requires
explanation, as it implies that the density of matter and energy in the
universe is exactly balanced. Any small deviation from this balance in the
early universe would have resulted in a universe that is either too dense (and
thus collapses on itself) or too sparse (and thus expands indefinitely).
4. Dark Matter and Dark Energy:
The Big Bang Theory doesn't explain the nature of dark matter and dark
energy, two mysterious components of the universe that together make up
about 95% of its total mass-energy density. Dark matter is a hypothetical
form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic
radiation, making it invisible to telescopes. Its existence is inferred from its
gravitational effects on visible matter. Dark energy, on the other hand, is a
{60}
hypothetical form of energy that is thought to be responsible for the
observed acceleration of the universe's expansion.
5. Before the Big Bang:
Finally, the Big Bang Theory doesn't explain what (if anything) existed before
the Big Bang, or what caused the Big Bang to occur. This is a fundamental
question that lies beyond the scope of the theory, and it remains one of the
most profound mysteries in cosmology. These unanswered questions have
led to various modifications and extensions of the Big Bang Theory, such as
the theory of cosmic inflation, and they are active areas of research in
cosmology…
Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and
Sikhism.
One of the most significant similarities among Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism,
and Sikhism is the belief in reincarnation and karma. Reincarnation is the
concept that the soul or consciousness or mind of a living being is reborn in a
new body after death. The quality of one's actions (karma) in this life
influences their future existence, including the circumstances of their next
birth.
The cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth is known as samsara, and liberation
from this cycle is a shared aspiration among these four religions. In Hinduism,
the ultimate goal is to attain moksha, or freedom from samsara, and unite
{61}
with Brahman, the ultimate reality or supreme cosmic power. In Buddhism,
the goal is to achieve nirvana element, a state of supreme enlightenment
where suffering and individual existence cease. Jains strive to attain
liberation of the soul (moksha) from samsara, and Sikhs seek to achieve a
state of spiritual enlightenment and union with God.
Hinduism is known for its diversity of beliefs and practices, with a wide range
of gods, rituals, and philosophical traditions. However, Hindus recognize the
ancient Rishis and Vedas as authoritative sources of knowledge and the
Brahmins as the priestly class. While some Hindus worship specific gods like
Shiva, Vishnu, or Shakti, they view them as various manifestations of a single
Ultimate Reality.
Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism also have their unique beliefs and practices,
but they share a common thread of seeking to understand and connect with
the ultimate reality, nature or supreme power. In Buddhism, the ultimate
reality is often described as emptiness or soullessness, and the goal is to
realize this reality through meditation and wisdom. Jains believe that the
ultimate reality is the soul, which is eternal, pure, and distinct from the
material world. Sikhs believe in a formless, omnipresent, and omnipotent
God, and the goal is to achieve a state of union with God through devotion
and spiritual growth.
Buddhism and Hinduism share a common cultural and historical background,
and there are many similarities between their beliefs and practices. One of
the fundamental beliefs of Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths, which
describe the nature of suffering and the path to its cessation. The Buddhist
concept of reincarnation is similar to the Hindu belief in samsara, and the
goal of achieving nirvana element is analogous to the Hindu aspiration of
moksha.
However, Buddhism also has its unique philosophical and ethical teachings,
such as the Middle Way, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Three Marks of
Existence. The Middle Way is a path of moderation between the extremes of
sensual indulgence and self-mortification. The Noble Eightfold Path is a set of
guidelines for ethical conduct, virtue or discipline, concentration and wisdom,
and it is the path that leads to the cessation of suffering and the attainment
{62}
of nirvana element. The Three Marks of Existence are impermanence,
suffering, and non-self, and they describe the fundamental characteristics of
existence.
Jainism and Hinduism share a common origin from the Vedic culture of
ancient India, and there are many similarities between their beliefs and
practices. Jains and Hindus both believe in the concept of reincarnation and
karma, and they view the ultimate goal of life as freedom from the cycle of
birth and death.
Jains and Hindus also share a common emphasis on non-violence (ahimsa)
and compassion for all living beings. Jainism is known for its strict adherence
to non-violence, including vegetarianism. Hindus also value non-violence and
compassion.
Sikhism emerged from the Bhakti movement within Hinduism, which
emphasized devotion to God and the equality of all creatures. Sikhism and
Hinduism share a common cultural and historical background, and there are
many similarities between their beliefs and practices.
One of the most significant similarities between Sikhism and Hinduism is the
belief in a formless, omnipresent, and omnipotent God. Sikhs believe in the
concept of Waheguru, which is often translated as "Wonderful Lord" or "One
God." Hindus also believe in a supreme god, Brahman, which is often
described as the ultimate reality or cosmic consciousness.
In summary, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism are four distinct
religions with their unique beliefs, practices, and histories. However, they
share some common philosophical ideologies, such as the belief in
reincarnation and karma, the aspiration for liberation from the cycle of birth
and death, and the emphasis on non-violence and compassion for all living
beings. These similarities reflect the common cultural and historical
background of these religions and the universal human quest for meaning,
purpose, and connection with the ultimate reality, nature or supreme
universal power…

The Limits of Folly.
The universe is a vast and complex place, full of mysteries and wonders that
have captivated the human imagination for centuries. From the origins of life
to the nature of consciousness, there are many questions that continue to
elude even the most brilliant minds. However, not everyone is equally
equipped to grapple with these complex and difficult questions such as
different worlds, different planes, inequality of beings, invisible planes,
karma, reincarnation, celestial beings and subtle natures. In this writing, we
will explore the reasons why fools cannot comprehend the universe's
intricacies and are not equal to wise men.
One of the primary reasons why fools are unable to comprehend the
universe's intricacies is the importance or seriousness of intelligence and
knowledge. The universe is a complex and ever-changing place, and
understanding it requires a deep intelligence and nuanced understanding of
many different fields of knowledge, including physics, meta-physics,
philosophy, dharma, biology, religion, chemistry, nature and mathematics.
The universe is an incredibly complex and vast thing, and understanding how
it works and how everything within it is interconnected is a challenging task
for several reasons.
Firstly, the universe is constantly evolving and changing, which makes it
difficult to comprehend its present state, let alone predict its future or
understanding the past. Moreover, the universe operates at different scales,
from the subatomic level to the cosmic level, and the laws that govern each
scale can be vastly different, making it challenging to form a unified
understanding of the universe.
{64}
Secondly, our understanding of the universe is limited by our perception and
cognitive abilities. Our senses can only perceive a narrow range of the
electromagnetic spectrum, and our brains or minds or consciousnesses have
evolved to process information in a certain way, which can limit our ability to
comprehend the universe's complexities.
Thirdly, the scientific study of the universe is a relatively recent endeavor,
and there is still much that we do not know or understand. The scientific
method is a slow and deliberate process, and it can take years or even
decades to gather and analyze data, formulate and test hypotheses, and
develop theories.
Lastly, the interconnectedness of the universe is a complex and abstract thing
that can be difficult to grasp. The idea that everything in the universe is
interconnected and that every action has a reaction can be challenging to
reconcile with our everyday experiences and intuition.
Understanding how the universe works and how everything within it is
interconnected is an extremely difficult task due to the universe's complexity,
our limited perception, knowing and cognitive abilities, the relatively recent
scientific study of the universe, and the abstract and complex nature of the
concept of interconnectedness.
Fools, on the other hand, are often characterized by a lack of intelligence and
knowledge. They may struggle to grasp even the most basic concepts and
may be unable to think critically or creatively about the world or universe
around them. This lack of intelligence and knowledge can make it virtually
impossible for them to comprehend the universe's intricacies.
Another key difference between fools and wise men when it comes to
understanding the universe's complexities is the role of critical thinking and
reasoning. The universe is a place of many mysteries and uncertainties, and
the path to understanding and discovery is often filled with twists and turns.
A wise person is someone who is able to think critically and reason logically,
to question assumptions and test hypotheses, to imagine, to realize and to
navigate the complex and ever-changing landscape of scientific discovery.
{65}
Fools, on the other hand, are often characterized by a lack of critical thinking
and reasoning skills. They may be easily swayed by superficial appearances or
by the opinions of others, and they may struggle to separate fact from fiction
in a complex and ever-changing world.
Finally, the differences between fools and wise men when it comes to
understanding the universe's complexities can be understood in terms of the
importance of curiosity and wonder. The universe is a place of endless
discovery and exploration, and the path to understanding and appreciation is
often paved with a sense of curiosity and wonder. A wise person is someone
who is able to maintain a sense of curiosity and wonder, even in the face of
adversity or uncertainty, and who is always eager to learn and discover new
things.
Fools, on the other hand, may lack this sense of curiosity and wonder. They
may be content with their limited understanding of the world, and they may
be unwilling or unable to venture beyond the boundaries of their own
experience and knowledge.
In addition to the above factors, the differences between fools and wise men
can also be understood in terms of the importance of virtue and good
character. Wise men are not only intelligent and knowledgeable but also
virtuous and of good character. They are honest, just, compassionate, and
humble, and they strive to do what is right, even in the face of adversity.
Fools, on the other hand, may lack these qualities of virtue and good
character. They may be dishonest, selfish, or arrogant, and they may
prioritize their own desires and interests above those of righteousness. This
lack of virtue and good character can make it difficult for them to
comprehend the universe's intricacies, as they may lack the moral and ethical
framework necessary to understand and appreciate the complexities of the
world around them and due to restless minds of them.
In summary, the limits of folly are significant and far-reaching. From the
importance of intelligence and knowledge to the role of critical thinking and
reasoning, to the importance of curiosity and wonder, and to the importance
of virtue and good character, there are many reasons why fools cannot
{66}
comprehend the universe's intricacies and are not equal to wise men. By
striving to become wiser and more enlightened, we can all aspire to be more
like the wise men of history and to better understand and appreciate the
complexities of the universe around us…
The Natural Law of Cause and Effect.
The fact of cause and effect, often referred to as the chain of causation or the
natural law, is a fundamental principle that helps us understand the
interconnected nature of events in the world around us. This principle
describes how one action or event leads to a result, which in turn leads to
another result, creating a chain of linked events.
To illustrate the fact, let's consider a simple example:
1. Cause: You turn the key in the ignition of your car.
Effect: The car engine starts.
2. Cause: The car engine starts.
Effect: The car begins to move forward.
3. Cause: The car is moving forward.
Effect: You steer the car to your desired destination.
4. Cause: You steer the car to your destination.
Effect: You arrive at your destination.
{67}
In this scenario, the initial action of turning the key in the ignition sets off a
series of subsequent events. Each event is the cause of the next effect,
creating a continuous chain of causation until the final outcome is achieved.
The chain of causation is governed by three key principles:
1. Temporal Sequence: The cause must always precede the effect in time. In
other words, the cause happens first, and then the effect follows.
2. Necessary Connection: There must be a direct and necessary connection
between the cause and the effect. This means that the cause directly leads to
the effect.
3. Predictability: If the same cause occurs under the same conditions, the
same effect should follow. This principle allows us to predict future events
based on past occurrences.
The doctrine of cause and effect is not just an abstract philosophical idea. It
has practical applications in various fields such as science, engineering,
economics, and even in our daily lives. It helps us make sense of the world,
predict future events, and make informed decisions.
In science, for instance, the principle of cause and effect is used to formulate
and test hypotheses. Scientists use this concept to predict the outcome of an
experiment based on the conditions and variables they control.
In economics, the principle is used to predict the impact of certain policies or
events on the economy. For example, an increase in interest rates by the
central bank (cause) could lead to a decrease in borrowing and spending by
consumers and businesses (effect).
In our daily lives, understanding cause and effect can help us make better
decisions. For example, if we know that eating unhealthy food (cause) can
lead to weight gain and health problems (effect), we can choose to maintain
a balanced diet.
{68}
let's explore some examples of cause and effect chains in daily life activities
and natural phenomena:
Walking:
Cause: You decide to take a step forward.
Effect: Your leg muscles contract, moving your leg and foot.
Cause: Your foot touches the ground.
Effect: Your body weight is transferred to the ground, creating a reaction
force that propels you forward.
Cause: Your center of mass shifts forward.
Effect: Your other leg swings forward, and the process repeats, allowing you
to walk.
Writing:
Cause: You decide to write something.
Effect: Your brain sends signals to the muscles in your hand and arm.
Cause: Your muscles contract and move your hand and fingers.
Effect: The pen or pencil you're holding makes contact with the paper,
leaving a mark.
Cause: The marks on the paper form letters or symbols.
Effect: The written words convey meaning and information.
Using Technology:
Cause: You press a key on your keyboard.
Effect: The keyboard sends an electrical signal to the computer.
Cause: The computer's processor receives and interprets the signal.
Effect: The computer displays the corresponding character on the screen.
Cause: The displayed character is part of a larger document or program.
Effect: The document or program is saved, shared, or executed, leading to
further actions and results.
Natural Actions:
Cause: Warm, moist air rises, creating a thunderstorm.
Effect: The rising air creates a difference in electrical charge between the
clouds and the ground.
Cause: The electrical charge builds up until it discharges in the form of a
lightning bolt.
{69}
Effect: The rapid heating of the air by the lightning bolt creates a shockwave,
producing the sound of thunder.
Cause: The sound of thunder travels at a slower speed than the speed of
light.
Effect: The time delay between seeing the lightning and hearing the thunder
can be used to estimate the distance of the lightning strike.
Body & Mind:
Cause: You have a thought or experience an emotion.
Effect: Your brain releases neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that carry
signals.
Cause: The neurotransmitters travel to different parts of your body through
the nervous system.
Effect: Various body parts, like your heart, lungs, and muscles, respond to
these signals.
Cause: The responses in your body lead to physical sensations or actions.
Effect: These physical sensations or actions can feedback to your brain,
influencing further thoughts and emotions.
(For example, if you think about a stressful situation, your brain might release
adrenaline. This chemical signal travels to your heart, causing it to beat
faster, and to your muscles, preparing them for action. As a result, you might
feel a racing heartbeat and tense muscles, which your brain interprets as
signs of stress, potentially perpetuating the cycle.)
Bodily Natures:
Cause: You have a sexual thought or encounter a sexually arousing stimulus.
Effect: Your brain releases neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and
norepinephrine, which trigger a sexual response.
Cause: The neurotransmitters travel to the genital area through the nervous
system, causing blood vessels to dilate.
Effect: Increased blood flow to the genitals leads to physical changes, such as
an erection in the penis or swelling and lubrication in the vagina.
Cause: The physical changes in the genitals, along with continued sexual
stimulation, can lead to orgasm.
{70}
Effect: Orgasm results in the release of hormones, such as oxytocin and
endorphins, which create feelings of pleasure, relaxation, and closeness to a
partner.
In each of these examples, a single action or event leads to a series of
interconnected results, creating a chain of cause and effect. Comprehending
the relationships between causes and effects is vital for interpreting the
world around us, anticipating results, and addressing challenges in numerous
fields. The natural law of cause and effect serves as a potent instrument,
guiding us through the intricacies of the world. By grasping the sequence of
causation, we can forecast, strategize, and make choices that steer us
towards our desired goals.
The natural principle of cause and effect is a fundamental cornerstone of our
understanding of the universe. Everything that happens in the world is the
result of one or more causes, and scientists are keenly aware of this fact,
which they refer to as the natural law of cause and effect. Science is deeply
rooted in the exploration and comprehension of cause and effect
relationships, which in turn, drives the progress of technology.
Science engages with the fact of cause and effect through a systematic and
rigorous process:
1. Observation and Hypothesis:
Scientists begin by observing the world around them, identifying patterns or
phenomena that they wish to understand. Based on these observations, they
formulate hypotheses about the potential causes and effects underlying the
observed phenomena.
2. Experimentation and Data Collection:
To test their hypotheses, scientists design experiments that manipulate
specific variables (potential causes) and observe the resulting changes
(effects). They collect data systematically, measuring and recording the
relevant variables and their relationships.
3. Establishing Causal Relationships:
{71}
Scientists analyze the data from their experiments, looking for consistent
patterns and correlations between the manipulated variables (causes) and
the observed outcomes (effects). They use statistical methods and logical
reasoning to determine whether the observed relationships are likely to be
causal, rather than just coincidental.
4. Developing Theories and Models:
When scientists can reliably establish causal relationships through repeated
experimentation and observation, they develop theories and models that
explain the underlying mechanisms and principles. These theories and
models help scientists make predictions about future events and guide
further research.
5. Refining and Validating Causal Explanations:
As new evidence emerges, scientists continuously refine and validate their
causal explanations, either confirming or modifying their theories and
models. This iterative process of testing, refining, and validating causal
relationships is the foundation of scientific progress.
6. Establishing Causality in Complex Systems:
In many scientific fields, such as biology, ecology, and social sciences, the
relationships between causes and effects can be complex, with multiple
interacting variables. Scientists use advanced statistical techniques and
systems-level approaches to untangle these complex causal relationships and
understand the underlying mechanisms.
The law of cause and effect is of paramount importance in the fields of
science and technology for several key reasons:
1. Understanding Mechanisms and Processes:
Identifying causal relationships is essential for understanding how natural
and technological systems work. By tracing the chain of causation, scientists
and engineers can uncover the underlying mechanisms and principles that
govern various phenomena, leading to the development of more accurate
models, theories, and predictive capabilities.
2. Establishing Reliable Explanations:
{72}
The scientific method relies heavily on the ability to establish causal
relationships through experimentation and observation. By demonstrating
that a specific cause leads to a particular effect, scientists can build a robust
and reliable body of knowledge, which forms the foundation for scientific
theories and laws, providing explanations for natural phenomena.
3. Enabling Prediction and Control:
Once causal relationships are established, scientists and engineers can use
this knowledge to predict future events and outcomes. This predictive power
is crucial for making informed decisions, planning, and designing effective
solutions. Furthermore, understanding cause and effect allows for the
manipulation and control of systems, enabling the development of new
technologies and the optimization of existing ones.
4. Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving:
In the realm of technology, the ability to trace the chain of causation is
essential for troubleshooting and problem-solving. By identifying the root
causes of issues, engineers can develop targeted solutions and prevent the
recurrence of problems. This causal reasoning is particularly important in
fields like computer science, where complex software and hardware systems
require a thorough understanding of the underlying causal relationships.
5. Advancing Scientific and Technological Progress:
The continuous exploration and refinement of causal relationships drive the
advancement of science and technology. As new discoveries are made and
causal explanations are improved, it leads to the development of more
accurate models, innovative technologies, and a deeper understanding of the
world around us. This progress, in turn, enables further scientific and
technological breakthroughs, creating a cycle of continuous improvement
and discovery.
In summary, the natural law of cause and effect is fundamental to the
scientific and technological endeavors, as it provides the framework for
understanding, predicting, and controlling the natural and artificial world. By
rigorously investigating causal relationships, scientists and engineers can
unlock the secrets of the universe and create transformative technologies
that improve our lives…

Spiritual Truth Seeker.
The human journey is a complex and multifaceted one, filled with a myriad of
experiences, challenges, and opportunities for growth. One of the most
profound and transformative paths that a person can embark on is the path
of the spiritual truth seeker. This writing aims to explore the importance of
becoming a spiritual truth seeker, the significance of discovering eternal
nature, and the quest for liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
The path of the spiritual truth seeker is a journey of self-discovery, inner
transformation, and the pursuit of the ultimate truth or reality. It is a journey
that requires courage, openness, and a deep commitment to personal and
spiritual growth.
Becoming a spiritual truth seeker is important for several reasons. Firstly, it
allows us to question and explore the nature of existence, the purpose of life,
and the mysteries of the universe. This can lead to a deeper understanding of
ourselves, others, and the world around us. Secondly, it encourages us to
look within and embark on a journey of self-discovery and inner
transformation. This can lead to greater self-awareness, emotional
intelligence, and spiritual maturity. Lastly, it invites us to connect with a
higher nature, a deeper truth, or a greater reality, which can provide a sense
of meaning, purpose, and spiritual fulfillment.
Finding the Eternal Nature:
The idea of the eternal nature refers to the enduring, timeless aspect of
existence. In many spiritual traditions, it is believed that beneath the surface
of our physical bodies and our transient thoughts and emotions, there is a
{74}
deeper, more enduring aspect of our being. This is often referred to as the
soul, the spirit, the mind or the true self.
Finding and connecting with eternal nature is significant for several reasons.
Firstly, it can provide a sense of stability, peace, and inner strength in the
face of life's challenges and changes. Secondly, it can help us to transcend the
limitations of our physical bodies and our ego-centered identities, and to
experience a deeper sense of interconnectedness with all beings. Lastly, it is a
deathless eternal nature which we must have.
In many spiritual traditions, the ultimate goal of the spiritual truth seeker is
liberation or freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. This is often
referred to as Moksha in Hinduism and Nirvana in Buddhism.
In summary, the path of the spiritual truth seeker is a journey of courage,
exploration, and transformation. It is a journey that invites us to question, to
seek, and to discover. It is a journey that encourages us to look within, to
grow, and to transform. It is a journey that connects us with the eternal, the
timeless, and the divine. The spiritual truth seeker seeks the the ultimate
truth of the universe. In a world that often emphasizes the superficial and the
transient, the path of the spiritual truth seeker is a valuable reminder of the
depth and the enduring nature of the human spirit…
Dark Matter: The Mysterious Invisible
Component of the Universe.
{75}
Dark matter is one of the most intriguing and mysterious concepts in modern
astrophysics and particle physics. It is a hypothetical form of matter that does
not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, which means it cannot
be directly detected using traditional astronomical tools that rely on light.
Instead, its existence and properties are inferred through its gravitational
effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the
universe.
The exact composition of dark matter is currently unknown, and it remains
one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in science. It's not made up of the
same particles that constitute ordinary matter, such as protons, neutrons,
and electrons. Dark matter particles also don't interact with the
electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces in the same way as ordinary matter,
which makes them extremely difficult to detect.
There are several theories about what dark matter might be. One of the
leading candidates is Weakly Interacting Massive particles (WIMPs), which
are hypothetical particles that interact with ordinary matter through the
weak nuclear force and gravity. Other candidates include axions (hypothetical
particles that are much lighter than WIMPs), sterile neutrinos (hypothetical
particles that don't interact with matter except through gravity), and
primordial black holes (hypothetical black holes that formed in the early
universe). However, none of these candidates have been definitively proven
to be the source of dark matter.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding its composition, the evidence for dark
matter's existence is quite strong. It's estimated to make up about 27% of the
total mass-energy density of the universe, with the remaining 68% being dark
energy and about 5% being ordinary matter. The effects of dark matter can
be seen in the rotation of galaxies, the gravitational lensing of light from
distant objects, and the large-scale structure of the universe.
Understanding the nature of dark matter is a key challenge for the coming
years in both particle physics and cosmology. Scientists are using a variety of
approaches to try to detect dark matter particles and study their properties.
These include underground experiments that search for WIMPs, experiments
that use powerful magnets to search for axions, and space-based telescopes
{76}
that search for the signatures of dark matter in the cosmic microwave
background radiation.
The search for dark matter is not only important for understanding the
fundamental nature of the universe, but it also has practical implications. For
example, the detection of dark matter particles could potentially lead to the
development of new technologies for energy production and storage.
In summary, dark matter is a mysterious and fascinating component of the
universe that has yet to be fully understood. The search for dark matter is
one of the most important and exciting areas of research in modern science,
and it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos…
Supernatural Powers in Buddhism.
Buddhism is a spiritual tradition that has been practiced for over 2,500 years,
and its founder, Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, is widely regarded as one of
the greatest spiritual teachers in history. While Buddhism is primarily
concerned with the attainment of liberation and the end of suffering, it also
acknowledges the existence of supernatural powers, known as "abinna" or
"super-normal powers," that can be acquired through meditations and
spiritual practices.
The Supernatural Powers of Buddha:
Buddha is said to have possessed a wide range of supernatural powers, which
he acquired through his intense meditation and spiritual practice. Some of
the most well-known of these powers include:
{77}
1. Yamaka Pratiharya: This power allowed Buddha to gush fire and water
from his body at the same time, and was said to be a result of his complete
mastery over the elements.
2. Flying Through the Sky: Buddha was said to be able to sit in a meditation
pose and then fly through the air, effortlessly soaring through the sky like a
bird.
3. Teleportation: Buddha was also said to be able to instantly teleport himself
from one location to another, a power that was said to be a result of his
complete control over the physical world.
4. Discussing with celestials: Buddha was said to have had discussions with
the divine and brahmic beings who dwell in the higher realms of existence,
who sought his guidance and wisdom.
5. Talking with Animals: Buddha was said to be able to communicate with
animals, such as the Parileyya elephant, and to understand their languages
and feelings.
7. Blazing Light Aura: Buddha was said to be surrounded by a blazing light
aura, which was a result of his intense spiritual energy.
8. Sabbannuta Nana: This is Omniscient Intelligence. This is what makes
Buddha different from another saint. The Omniscient Intelligence of the
Buddha is a unique intelligence that only Buddhas in the universe possess.
Other saints cannot attain this intelligence because it requires an extensive
accumulation of meritorious karmas from many past lives. This is the
Buddha's supreme and ultimate form of knowledge, granting him access to
all information in the universe, both spiritual and mundane.
In this writing, we will explore various types of abinna or supernatural powers
that are said to be attainable by those who follow the Buddhist path. But
these powers are not the goal of spiritual practices. These powers are byproducts of spiritual path.
Types of Abinna:
In addition to the supernatural powers of Buddha, the Buddhist scriptures
also describe a wide range of Abinnas that can be acquired through
meditation and spiritual practice. Some of the most well-known of these
powers include:
{78}
1. Manifoldness: This power allows the practitioner to create multiple copies
of themselves, and is said to be a result of the ability to manipulate the
physical world.
2. Mind-Made Body: This power allows the practitioner to create a body out
of pure mental energy, and is said to be a result of the concentration.
3. Divine Eye: Also known as "dibba cakku," this power allows the practitioner
to see things that are not visible to the ordinary human eyes, including the
past and future, and is said to be a result of the ability to perceive reality
beyond the limitations of the physical senses.
4. Divine Ear: Also known as "dibba sota," this power allows the practitioner
to hear things as that are inaudible to ordinary human ears, and is said to be
a result of the ability to perceive reality beyond the limitations of the physical
senses.
5. Recollection of Past Lives: This power allows the practitioner to remember
their past lives, and is said to be a result of the ability to perceive reality
beyond the limitations of the physical senses.
6. Walking on Water: This power allows the practitioner to walk on the
surface of water, and is said to be a result of the ability to control the
elements.
7. Going Through Walls: This power allows the practitioner to pass through
solid objects, such as walls and mountains, and is said to be a result of the
ability to manipulate the physical world.
8. Touching the Sun and Moon: This power allows the practitioner to touch
the sun and moon, and is said to be a result of the ability to control the
physical world.
9. Knowing Others’ Thoughts: This power enables the practitioner to know
the thoughts of any creature, regardless of whether they are near, distant,
visible, or invisible.
Kasina Meditations:
One of the primary methods for acquiring abinna in Buddhism is through the
practice of kasina meditations. These meditations involve focusing the mind
on a single object, such as a colored disk or a flame, or an element.
Some of the most well-known kasina meditations include:
{79}
1. Earth Kasina Meditation: This meditation involves concentrating the mind
on a disk of earth element.
2. Air Kasina Meditation: This meditation involves concentrating the mind on
air element.
3. Fire Kasina Meditation: This meditation involves concentrating the mind on
fire element.
4. Water Kasina Meditation: This meditation involves concentrating the mind
on to water element.
The supernatural powers of Buddha, as described in the Buddhist scriptures,
are a testament to the incredible potential of the human mind. While the
attainment of Abinnas is not the primary goal of Buddhism, it is
acknowledged as a natural byproduct of intense meditation and spiritual
practice. Through the practice of Kasina meditations and other forms of
spiritual practices, it is said that anyone can acquire these powers and tap
into the infinite potential of the nature…
A Scientific Examination of the NonExistence of an Almighty God.
The concept of an almighty god has been a central tenet of many religions
throughout history. The belief in a divine being or a creator that has
complete control over the world and the lives of its inhabitants is often seen
as a source of comfort and guidance for many. However, a closer
examination of the world and the experiences of individuals, both believers
and non-believers, raises serious questions about the existence of an
{80}
almighty god. In this writing, we will explore the evidence for the nonexistence of an almighty god and the ways in which the world does not
appear to be controlled by such a being.
The Problem of Evil:
One of the most significant challenges to the existence of an almighty god is
the problem of evil. The world is filled with suffering, pain, and destruction,
much of which seems to be completely random and undeserved. If an
almighty god exists and is truly all-powerful, all-loving and all-knowing, then
it is difficult to understand why such a supreme being or creator would allow
for so much suffering in the world.
Believers of almighty god become sick, experience the destruction of wealth
and money, suffer from poisoning, and become subject to bomb attacks and
natural disasters. Moreover, believers of almighty god are not immune to the
effects of aging, pain, and death. These experiences are not unique to
believers, as non-believers also experience these same challenges and
tragedies.
The fact that both believers and non-believers are subject to sicknesses,
aging, pain, natural disasters, and death equally suggests that these
experiences are not the result of divine intervention or punishment, but
rather are a natural part of the world.
The Absence of Divine Intervention:
Another piece of evidence for the non-existence of an almighty god is the
absence of divine intervention in the world. If an almighty god exists and is
truly all-powerful, then it stands to reason that such a being would be able to
intervene in the world in a clear and unmistakable way. However, there is
little evidence to suggest that this is the case.
Those who pray for the almighty god become sick and go to see a doctor,
become subject to cancer, and do not receive money from the almighty god,
even if they believe and pray for it. These experiences suggest that prayer
and belief in an almighty god do not necessarily result in divine intervention
or protection.
{81}
Moreover, the fact that believers of almighty god come to low ranks in
school, commit suicide, and die in vehicle accidents, despite their belief and
potential prayers for protection, suggests that the world is not controlled by
a divine being or creator that is able to intervene in a meaningful way.
The Imperfect World:
Another piece of evidence for the non-existence of an almighty god is the
imperfect nature of the world. If an almighty god created the world, then it
stands to reason that such a being would create a world that is perfect and
free from flaws and mistakes. However, the world is filled with imperfections,
injustices, and inequalities.
Believers of almighty god suffer from stupidity and do not receive good luck
always, despite their belief and potential prayers for such blessings.
Moreover, the fact that some persons believe in almighty god, yet they
become subject to pain, sicknesses, and not having their wishes come true,
suggests that the world is not controlled by a divine being that is able to
grant blessings and answer prayers in a consistent and reliable way.
The fact that both believers and non-believers are subject to the
imperfections of the world equally suggests that these experiences are not
the result of divine intervention or punishment, but rather are a natural part
of the world.
The Existence of Non-Believers:
The fact that non-believers exist is also evidence for the non-existence of an
almighty god creator. If an almighty god exists and is truly all-powerful, then
it is difficult to understand why such a supreme being would allow for the
existence of individuals who do not believe in it.
Moreover, the fact that those who do not believe in almighty god are able to
prove the non-existence of such a being, and that the almighty god never
shows itself and defends its existence, suggests that the concept of an
almighty god is a human construct, rather than a true and objective reality.
In conclusion, the evidence for the non-existence of an almighty god is
compelling. The problem of evil, the absence of divine intervention, the
{82}
imperfect nature of the world, and the existence of non-believers all suggest
that the world is not controlled by a divine supreme being that is allpowerful, all-knowing, and all-loving. It is important to critically examine the
evidence, nature and consider the ways in which the world does not appear
to be controlled by such a creator being…

Isidasi Nun and Her Divine Eye.
Isidasi, the daughter of a baron who became a nun in Gautama Buddha’s
organization, soon attained liberation as an arhant bhikkhuni.
One day, after finishing her alms round in Patna city, she rested near the
riverbank. Her friend, the nun Bodhi, was also resting next to her. The
conversation between the two arhant bhikkhunis at that time is recorded in
the Buddhist scriptures.
“Venerable Isidasi, you are still young and very beautiful. For what reason did
you become ordained? Why did you become a nun?”
“Venerable Bodhi, I will tell you why I became a nun. Listen to me. My father
was a baron in Ujjain. I was his beloved daughter. At a young age, I was
married off to a rich baron in Saketa, who was a friend of my father.”
“Since I got married and moved to Saketa, I washed my aunt's and uncle's
(father-in-law) feet in the morning and evening. If my husband's brothers,
sisters, and family members came home, I would get up from my seat so they
could be seated and honored. I prepared and served food appropriately.”
{85}
“I went to my husband at the right time and adorned him with perfume like a
maid. I prepared food, cleaned the dishes, and treated my husband like a
mother treats her only son.”
“Although I treated my husband with respect, he did not love me. Despite
behaving modestly, not lazily, and politely towards him, he soon got tired of
me and started to dislike me.”
“One day, he said, 'I can't live married life with Isidasi anymore. Send her to
her parents.'”
“'Child, don't say that. Isidasi is intelligent, dutiful, and not lazy. She treats
you well. Why don't you like her?' asked his parents.”
“'She doesn't hurt me, but I don't want to be with her anymore,' he replied.”
Because her husband insisted on sending her back to her parents, Isidasi
returned to her parent’s house. Without any grudge, she went to her
parents.
“Father, I have not done anything wrong to my husband. I didn’t do anything
bad or say a bad word. But I came back because he said he does not like me,”
Isidasi said.
After a while, Isidasi's father remarried her to another man. At his house,
Isidasi did all the work like a maid, respected her husband, was a good dutiful
wife and harbored no malice, as before. But after about a month, he also got
tired of her. Then again she had to return to her parent’s house.
One day, Isidasi's father saw a young man begging with dirty clothes and a
broken pot. He immediately bathed him in fragrant water, dressed him in
beautiful clothes and ornaments, and said, "Child, from today onward you
may not go begging. Marry my daughter, take care of this property and
riches, and live in this mansion." That young man agreed. Isidasi also honored
him and treated him well just like she did to her previous husbands. Despite
this, he also disliked her after about a month. “I don't like living with Isidasi. I
{86}
want to go back to begging. It is better to beg than to be with my wife
Isidasi,” he said and left the mansion.
That day, Isidasi went to her room and cried the whole night. “Why does
every man hate me? Why do all men dislike me, even though I am an
obedient and dutiful wife?” she thought to herself. “What is the meaning of
this life? Should I commit suicide and die, or should I become a nun?” she
pondered.
After some time, one day, the wise and virtuous nun Jinadatta came to my
mansion for alms. Seeing her, I bowed at her feet, invited her into my home,
and offered alms.
“Venerable nun, I also want to become a Buddhist nun,” I told to venerable
nun Jinadatta.
My father heard this and said, “Daughter, why do you think of becoming a
Buddhist nun? Stay in this house, follow the Dhamma, and offer alms.”
“Father, you have seen the sufferings I have endured in this short period,
haven't you? How embarrassed I was! I have suffered a lot, more than any
girl should have to bear. Therefore, Father, allow me to become a nun. Let
me abandon this lay life and end all these sufferings to rest in the great
nirvana.” She pleaded, bowing at her father's feet.
With her father's permission, she went to a Buddhist nunnery and became a
nun. Within seven days, she meditated continuously and reached fruition.
She became a liberated arhant nun, attaining the three intelligences. Then
she obtained the divine eye and the ability to see her past lives. One day, she
watched how she spent her time in the cycle of reincarnation.
In one previous life, she was a man and the son of a very rich goldsmith in a
village named Eraka. He spent his life as a young man with a beautiful face
and body. However, due to bad associations and bad friends, he committed
sins greedily and lustfully by engaging in illicit sexual intercourse with various
women. After that life, where she was a man, she was born into hell for a
very very long time, suffering greatly. After that life in hell, she became a
{87}
monkey in the womb of a female monkey. On the seventh day after the baby
monkey was born, the great monkey leader removed the baby's male organs,
causing severe injury and great suffering. These were the results of the sins
the past mistakes done when she was a man and a son of a rich goldsmith.
From that life, she died and was born as a baby goat in the womb of a blind
and humpbacked goat (doe) that lived in a forest. She was caught by humans,
and to lift heavy loads, the goat owner crushed the goat's male organs. That
goat pulled heavy loads for twelve years, suffering from ulcerated and worminfested sores. This was also a result of the wrongful, sinful illicit sexual acts
committed in her previous life as a man and the son of a rich goldsmith.
After that life, she was born as a bull in the womb of a cow who lived on a
farm owned by a cattle dealer. One year after birth, the bull's male organs
were removed to make it better at pulling weight. It carried heavy loads until
it became very sick and died. This too was the result of bad karma collected
in her male life as the son of a rich goldsmith.
In the next life, I was born in the house of a slave girl in a certain street. I was
not possible to be a woman or a man in that life. My gender was neither a
man nor a woman. It is also was the result of my sinful karmas done in my
male life as the son of a rich goldsmith.
After that life I was born as a daughter, a girl in a house of a very poor cart
driver. Being poor, he never got food to satisfy his hunger. People came
every day asking him to repay the loans he had borrowed from them. As the
girl was crying because her father could not pay the debt, someone took her
by force. Then I was a sixteen years old girl. That man had a son named
Giridasa. He took her to his house. He had a virtuous, dutiful and devoted
wife. I was Jealous of her. So I did various things to make that wife
unpleasant to him. I made him angry about that his other wife.
So even when I provide all the services to my husbands like a maid, they
leave me because of that karmic reward. But I, the Isidasi, ended all those
karmas in this life. I have no rebirth and no suffering again…

Understanding Nature and the Universe.
The natural world and the universe beyond are awe-inspiring in their beauty
and complexity. From the intricate patterns of a snowflake to the vast
expanse of the cosmos, there is so much to discover and understand. But
why is it important to realize and understand nature and the universe? In this
writing, we will explore the many reasons why studying the workings of the
natural world and the cosmos is beneficial for individuals and society as a
whole.
One of the most obvious reasons for understanding nature and the universe
is the potential for scientific advancement. By studying the natural world, we
can gain insights into the fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, and
biology. This knowledge can then be used to develop new technologies,
improve medical treatments, and address environmental challenges. For
example, the study of biomimicry, which involves using nature as a model for
innovation, has led to the development of more efficient and sustainable
products, such as wind turbines inspired by the way humpback whales swim.
In addition to its practical benefits, understanding nature and the universe
can also lead to a greater appreciation of their beauty and complexity. By
learning about the intricate workings of an ecosystem or the life cycle of a
star, we can gain a deeper sense of awe and wonder. This, in turn, can have
psychological benefits, such as increased happiness and reduced stress.
Moreover, this appreciation can also inspire us to protect and preserve the
natural world and the cosmos, so that future generations can also experience
their beauty and complexity.
Understanding nature is also crucial for addressing the environmental
challenges that we face. By studying the natural world, we can gain a better
understanding of the impact of human activities on the environment. This
knowledge can then be used to develop more sustainable and
{89}
environmentally-friendly practices. For example, the study of climate science
has helped us understand the causes and consequences of global warming,
and has led to the development of strategies for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
The study of nature and the universe can also provide philosophical insights
into the nature of reality, the meaning of life, and the nature of knowledge.
For example, the discovery of the laws of thermodynamics has led to
philosophical discussions about the nature of time and the ultimate fate of
the universe. Similarly, the study of evolution has led to philosophical
discussions about the nature of morality and the relationship between
humans and other animals.
Nature and the universe have long been sources of inspiration for art and
culture. From the cave paintings of our ancestors to the modern-day nature
documentaries, the beauty and complexity of the natural world have been a
muse for artists and storytellers. By understanding nature and the universe
better, we can continue to draw inspiration from them and create works that
reflect and celebrate their beauty and complexity.
The study of nature and the universe can also contribute to education and
learning. By studying the natural world, we can develop critical thinking skills,
encourage curiosity and exploration, and provide a foundation for
understanding other subjects, such as physics, biology, and chemistry.
Moreover, the study of the universe can also help us understand our place in
the cosmos and the history of our planet.
Understanding how nature works can also help us survive and adapt to
different environments. For example, understanding weather patterns can
help us prepare for natural disasters, and understanding the principles of
evolution can help us understand how to protect ourselves from diseases.
Moreover, the study of the universe can also help us understand the
potential threats and opportunities that exist beyond our planet, such as
asteroid impacts and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
Finally, understanding the universe and nature can provide spiritual
knowledge about our existence, how the universe works, and how everything
{90}
is interconnected. This allows us to understand natural phenomena, dharma,
consciousness, the elements, and karma.
In summary, the importance of realizing and understanding nature and the
universe cannot be overstated. From scientific advancement to spiritual
connection, the benefits of studying the natural world and the cosmos are
many and varied…
A donkey speaks.
Hello, I'm a donkey, a simple creature living a humble life. I spend my days in
the warm sun, grazing on the lush, green grass that I so dearly love. The taste
of it, the smell of the earthy soil beneath it, it's all a part of my world, a world
that I understand and cherish.
As a donkey, I love to do simple things. I enjoy spending my days grazing in
the fields, feeling the soft grass under my hooves and the warm sun on my
back. Also, I'm a social creature, I enjoy the company of my fellow donkeys,
especially the female ones. The simplicity of our courtship, the joy of
companionship, it's all a part of the life cycle that I am content with.
Additionally, I love to take a good nap, preferably in a shady spot during the
hottest part of the day. I also enjoy a good roll in the dirt or sand, it helps to
keep my coat clean and healthy. I find joy in the simple things in life, and
that's what I love to do.
Grass and mud are two of my favorite things. I absolutely love to graze on
fresh, green grass. The taste, the texture, the smell, it's all a part of the joy of
{91}
eating for me. Grass is not only a source of food, but also a source of comfort
and contentment. Mud, on the other hand, serves a different purpose. I
enjoy rolling in it, it helps to keep my coat clean and healthy. The coolness of
the mud also provides relief on a hot day. It's a simple pleasure, but one that
I greatly appreciate. In my simple world, grass and mud are two of the most
important elements. They provide me with food, comfort, and a sense of
belonging. I couldn't imagine my life without them.
Also, I have a great appreciation for my female counterparts. They are strong,
resilient, hot and play an important role in our social structure. I enjoy
spending time with them, whether it's grazing together in the fields or
engaging in courtship rituals. I also admire their maternal instincts. The way
they care for their young, protecting and nurturing them, is truly remarkable.
It's a testament to the strong bond that exists within our donkey families. I
have a lot of love for the female donkeys in my life. I am so fond of my
women.
I can live in a variety of environments, but I am most commonly found in dry,
arid regions such as deserts and grasslands. I am well-adapted to these
environments, with my tough and durable hooves, my ability to go for long
periods without water, and my diet of coarse, dry vegetation. However, I can
also be found in other environments, such as mountains, forests, and even in
some urban and suburban areas. I am a versatile creature, and I can adapt to
a wide range of living conditions. In terms of specific living arrangements, I
may live in a herd with other donkeys, or I may be kept alone or in pairs by
humans. I may be housed in a stable or barn, or I may be allowed to roam
and graze freely in a field or pasture. Regardless of where I live, I am content
as long as I have access to food, water, and the company of my fellow female
donkeys.
As a donkey, my life is generally quite simple and free of major troubles.
However, there are a few challenges that I sometimes face. In dry or barren
areas, it can be difficult to find enough grass to eat or water to drink. This can
be a source of stress and discomfort. Another challenge is the threat of
predators. While I am not the primary prey for most predators, I am still
vulnerable to attacks, especially when I am sick. Additionally, I am sometimes
used for work by humans, such as carrying heavy loads or pulling carts. This
{92}
can be physically demanding and sometimes even harmful if not done
properly.
I'm not one to ponder about the complexities of the universe or the
mysteries of nature. I believe in what I can see, what my eyes can see, what I
can experience by my eyes. To me, thoughts are just a mix of matter and
brain, a simple process that even a donkey like me can understand. Thoughts
occur due to physical matter or materials. Thoughts arise as a result of the
physical, material processes occurring in the brain and body. In my world, life
is about eating, reproducing, and finding joy in the simple pleasures. Grass,
mud, water, and the company of other animals are some of the most
important things in my life. I believe that events occur without any specific
cause.
I advise you to not worry too much about the things that you cannot
understand or control. The universe is big and complex, and it's okay to not
have all the answers.
I'm not the most intelligent of creatures, and I'm okay with that. I don't have
the mental capacity to understand or solve complex problems, and that's
alright. I don't need to understand the laws of physics or the theory of
relativity or the laws of nature to live a fulfilling life. I find joy in the simple
things, and that's enough for me. I laugh at the attempts of other supposedly
"wise" animals like lions and owls to comprehend the mysteries of nature.
That kind of abstract thinking is beyond my capabilities. I prefer to live in the
good moment, appreciating the grass beneath my hooves and the warmth of
the sun on my back. My thoughts are basic, centered on satisfying my
immediate needs and desires. Lions and owls seem to be always caught up in
their own worlds, forgetting to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. But I don't
waste my time trying to figure out the intricacies of the universe or ponder
deep philosophical questions. Instead, I'm content focusing on the simple
pleasures in life - eating, resting, and enjoying the company of my fellow
donkeys.
I have wishes, simple ones. A never-ending field of grass, a clear blue sky, and
the company of my fellow donkeys. That's my idea of a perfect universe, a
universe that I can understand and appreciate. In my world, ignorance is
{93}
bliss. I don't worry about the complexities of life, and that allows me to enjoy
it to the fullest. So, my advice to you is, don't always try to understand
everything. Sometimes, just experience it, enjoy it. After all, life is not a
puzzle to be solved, but a journey to be enjoyed.
I am content with who I am and the world around me, and I am grateful for
the simple pleasures that life has to offer. I am also happy to share my
perspective and experiences, and I hope that they can bring some joy and
inspiration to others. In my view, existence is a journey to be enjoyed, and I
am glad to be a part of it…
Intelligence Behind Understanding the
Unseen.
The human mind is a remarkable tool, capable of understanding and
interpreting a vast array of ideas, from the tangible and concrete to the
unseen and abstract. However, the latter often poses a greater challenge.
Understanding or realizing unseen, invisible, or abstract things requires a
high level of cognitive ability and intelligence. This writing explores the
reasons behind this and sheds light on the complex processes involved in
comprehending the unseen.
Unseen or invisible things, by their very nature, cannot be directly observed
or experienced. This lack of tangible evidence means that one must rely on
indirect information, logical reasoning, or abstract thinking to understand
them. For instance, while we cannot see gravity, we can observe its effects
and use that information to understand the concept. This ability to infer and
extrapolate from limited information is a hallmark of intelligence.
{94}
Abstract things are not rooted in the physical, tangible world. They are ideas
or qualities or natures that cannot be experienced through our senses, such
as eye, ear, or body. To understand these, one must be able to think beyond
what is immediately perceptible and grapple with complex, intangible ideas.
This form of thinking, known as abstract reasoning, is a sophisticated
cognitive process that requires a certain level of intellectual prowess.
Sometimes, understanding unseen situations or invisible phenomena involves
recognizing patterns, making predictions, and inferring based on limited or
indirect information. For example, in the field of astronomy, scientists use
patterns in the movement of visible celestial bodies to predict the existence
and behavior of those that are not directly observable. This process, a blend
of pattern recognition and logical inference, can be cognitively demanding
and is a key aspect of intelligence.
Many unseen or abstract natures are inherently complex and multifaceted.
They require a deep understanding of multiple interconnected ideas and the
ability to synthesize this information into a coherent whole. Consider, for
instance, the theory of relativity or the principles of quantum mechanics.
These concepts are not only unseen but also incredibly complex, requiring a
high level of intelligence to fully comprehend. Also not everything can be
proven through logic. There are certain natures or aspects of nature that
logic cannot verify.
Finally, understanding unseen or abstract concepts or natures often requires
a willingness to entertain ideas that may not align with one's current
understanding or belief system. This open-mindedness, the ability to
question one's assumptions and consider alternative perspectives, is a key
aspect of intelligence and critical thinking.
In summary, the ability to understand and realize unseen, invisible, or
abstract natures or realities is a testament to the power, intelligence and
flexibility of the human mind. It requires a blend of logical reasoning, abstract
thinking, pattern recognition, deep knowledge and open-mindedness, all of
which are key components of intelligence. It's easy to understand simple
{95}
things. However, comprehending complex and abstract natures that are not
immediately apparent and invisible requires a higher level of intelligence…
Complexity of Intelligence.
The question of why there seem to be more individuals who are perceived as
"unintelligent" or "foolish" and fewer who are seen as "wise" is a complex
one. It's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and understanding,
recognizing that the terms "unintelligent," "foolish," or "stupid" are often
subjective and can unfairly label a person's capabilities or potential in some
cases. This writing aims to delve into the factors influencing the distribution
of intelligence and wisdom and challenge our perceptions of these traits.
However, It is evident that there are both wise and foolish people, and they
differ in their levels of intelligence.
The distribution of abilities and traits of intelligence or wisdom, among any
population is influenced by a multitude of factors, as we materialistic people
see it.
1. Education and Resources: Access to quality education, resources for
learning, and opportunities for intellectual growth can significantly impact a
person's ability to develop their intelligence or wisdom. Unfortunately, these
resources are not evenly distributed globally. In many parts of the world,
access to education is limited due to economic, political, or social factors.
This lack of access can limit a person's ability to develop their cognitive
abilities and reach their full potential.
2. Environment and Upbringing: The environment in which a person is raised,
including their family, community, and cultural influences, can also play a
{96}
substantial role in their intellectual and personal development. For example,
a supportive and stimulating environment can foster curiosity, creativity, and
critical thinking, while a restrictive or neglectful environment can hinder
these traits.
3. Genetics: While not the sole determining factor, some research has shown
that genetics can influence a person's cognitive abilities to some extent.
Certain genetic factors may affect a person's memory, processing speed, and
problem-solving skills. However, it's important to note that genetics is just
one piece of the puzzle, and environmental factors can also significantly
impact a person's cognitive development. The involvement of genetics in this
case is somewhat controversial.
The Nature of Wisdom:
Wisdom, in particular, is a trait that often develops over time. It involves not
just knowledge or intelligence, but also the ability to apply that knowledge in
a thoughtful, empathetic, practical and effective way. This can involve
learning from mistakes, seeking diverse perspectives, and reflecting on one's
own experiences and beliefs.
Moreover, wise individuals may not always be the most visible or vocal in
society. They may be quietly working within their communities, or they may
express their wisdom in ways that are not always recognized or valued by
mainstream society. For example, wisdom can be expressed through
storytelling, mentoring, secret service or community service, and these forms
of expression may not always be acknowledged as "wise" by those who
equate wisdom with formal education or professional success.
Our perceptions of intelligence or wisdom can often be influenced by our
own biases and perspectives. For example, we may equate intelligence with
academic success or the ability to solve complex problems, while overlooking
other forms of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence or creative
intelligence. Similarly, we may equate wisdom with age or experience, while
overlooking the wisdom that can be found in some youths.
{97}
It's important to challenge these perceptions and recognize that intelligence
and wisdom can manifest in many different ways. By fostering
understanding, empathy, and respect for these differences, we can create a
world that values and nurtures the intelligence or wisdom in all of us.
In summary, the distribution of intelligence and wisdom is influenced by a
multitude of factors. It's important to remember that everyone has unique
strengths, weaknesses, and perspectives, and that intelligence or wisdom can
manifest in many different ways…
The Supernatural Powers of Rishis.
In ancient Indian spiritual traditions, it is believed that rishis, or enlightened
sages, possessed supernatural powers that they obtained through deep
meditation and spiritual practices. These powers, known as siddhis, were said
to include the ability to fly through the sky, walk on water, and even become
as small as an atom or as heavy as a mountain.
Akasa Gamana: Flying Through the Sky:
One of the most incredible siddhis attributed to rishis is the ability to fly
through the sky, known as Akasa Gamana. It is said that rishis would sit in a
meditation pose and then rise up into the air, effortlessly soaring through the
sky like a bird. This power was said to be a result of their complete mastery
over the elements and their ability to tap into the infinite energy of the mind,
nature and universe.
Jala Gamana: Walking on Water:
{98}
Another amazing siddhi attributed to rishis is the ability to walk on water,
known as Jala Gamana. It is said that rishis would simply step onto the
surface of the water and then walk across it as if it were solid ground. This
power was said to be a result of their complete control over the elements
and their ability to create a field of energy that would support their weight.
Anima, Garima, and Lagima: Becoming Small, Heavy, or Light:
Rishis were also said to possess the ability to become as small as an atom, as
heavy as a mountain, or as light as a feather. These powers, known as Anima,
Garima, and Lagima, were said to be a result of their complete mastery over
the own mind and nature.
The Path to Siddhis:
While the idea of possessing supernatural powers may seem appealing, it is
important to note that the path to Siddhis is not an easy one for worldly
people filled with various desires. Because it requires dedicated meditation
and spiritual practice, as well as a complete renunciation of the material
world. In fact, many spiritual traditions warn against the pursuit of Siddhis, as
they can be a distraction from the ultimate goal which is freedom from birth,
existence, death and reincarnation.
The Power of Meditation:
Regardless of whether or not one believes in the existence of Siddhis, there is
no denying the power of meditation. Numerous scientific research studies
have shown that meditation can have a profound impact on both the mind
and the body, reducing stress, improving focus, and even boosting the
immune system. By sitting in stillness and concentrating the mind, we can tap
into a deep sense of peace and inner wisdom that can transform our lives.
In summary, the supernatural powers of rishis, such as flying through the sky
or walking on water, are a fascinating aspect of ancient Indian spiritual
traditions. While the existence of these powers may be a matter of debate
for materialistic skeptical people who judge everything according to physical
matters, the power of meditations and spiritual practices is undeniable. It is
{99}
fact that by dedicating ourselves to the spiritual practices, we can tap into a
deep sense of peace and wisdom that can transform our lives…
Life's Greatest Questions.
The human mind is a remarkable tool, capable of pondering the deepest
mysteries of existence. Throughout history, philosophers, spiritual teachers,
and ordinary individuals have contemplated subjects that delve into the
heart of what it means to be alive. This writing aims to explore why we
should contemplate on profound subjects such as, the nature of the self, the
afterlife, the ultimate truth, and liberation.
Why People and Beings are Not Equal:
Contemplating the question of equality can lead to a deeper understanding
of the nature of existence and the interconnectedness of all beings. It is
evident that people and beings are not equal in terms of their physical and
mental abilities, their life circumstances, life spans, health, wealth, power and
their access to resources. By contemplating this question, we can cultivate
insight into the reality of true nature. What is the secret behind the
inequality of beings is a question thought by all the wise men.
Who Am I and What is the Self:
The questions 'Who am I?' and 'What is the self?' are central to many
philosophical and spiritual traditions. By contemplating these questions, we
can gain a deeper understanding of our own nature and the nature of
consciousness. Are we merely our physical bodies, our thoughts and
emotions, or is there a deeper, more enduring aspect of our being? The
{100}
exploration of these questions can lead to a greater understanding of the
reality of true nature.
What Happens After Death:
The questions about the afterlife and the nature of the soul have been a part
of human inquiry since time immemorial. By contemplating these questions,
we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of life and death, and the
possibility of continuity of consciousness beyond the physical body. What is
the soul or spirit, and how does it relate to the physical body? Is there a cycle
of birth and death, or is death a final end? These are also problems that
should be solved by the wise men.
The Best Pleasure and the True Nature of Reality:
The questions about the best pleasure and the true nature of reality can lead
to a deeper understanding of the nature of happiness and the nature of
existence. What is the most profound and enduring form of happiness or
pleasure? Is it found in material possessions, relationships, or inner states of
being? What is the true nature of reality? Is it merely the physical world that
we perceive with our senses, or is there a deeper, more subtle dimension of
reality? These complex questions can stimulate a sense of wonder, a desire
for inner growth, and a shift in perspective about what truly matters in life
and these questions also thought by a wise man.
The Eternal Nature, the Universe, and the Ultimate Truth:
The questions about the eternal nature, the workings of the universe, and
the ultimate truth can lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of time
and space, the nature of existence, and the nature of truth. What is the
eternal or timeless aspect of existence? What is the permanent thing? How
does the universe work, and what are its underlying principles? What is the
ultimate truth or reality that underlies and unites all things? What is the truth
about eternal nature? How to attain the eternal nature? These questions also
should be thought by the wise men.
The Correct Liberation:
{101}
The question about the correct liberation can lead to a deeper understanding
of the nature of suffering, the nature of freedom, and the path of spiritual
transformation. What is the true nature of suffering, and how can it be
transcended? What is the nature of spiritual freedom or liberation, and how
can it be attained? What is the correct liberation? What is the ultimate
liberation? By contemplating these deep questions, we can gain a clearer
vision of our spiritual path, a deeper commitment to our spiritual practices,
and a greater sense of purpose and meaning and these questions also
thought by wise men in the world.
In summary, contemplating on profound subjects is a journey into the heart
of what it means to be alive. It is a spiritual journey that can lead to a deeper
understanding of ourselves, others, nature and the universe around us. It is a
journey that can stir a sense of awe and curiosity for the mystery of
existence. In a world that often emphasizes the superficial and the transient,
the practice of contemplation of deep matters is a valuable reminder of the
depth and the enduring nature of the human spirit…
Devaduta Sutra: The divine Messengers.
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One (the Buddha) was staying
near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. There the Blessed
One addressed the monks, "Monks."
"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.
{102}
The Blessed One said, "Monks, it's as if there were two households with
doors, and a man of good eyesight, standing there between them, would see
people entering & leaving a house, wandering out & about. In the same way,
I — by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human — see
beings passing away & re-appearing, and I discern how they are inferior &
superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their
actions: 'O, how these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of
body, speech, & mind, who did not revile noble ones, who held right views
and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the breakup of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, the
heavenly world. Or how these beings — who were endowed with bad
conduct of body, speech & mind, who reviled noble ones, held wrong views
and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the breakup of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the realm of the hungry
ghosts. Or how these beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of
body, speech & mind, who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and
undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up
of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the animal womb. Or how
these beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech &
mind, who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions
under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after
death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower
realm, hell.'
"Then the hell-wardens, seizing (such a being) by the arms, present him to
King Yama: 'This is a man, your majesty, with no respect for mother, no
respect for father , no reverence for contemplatives, no reverence for
brahmans, no honor for the leaders of his clan. Let your majesty decree his
punishment.'
"Then King Yama interrogates & interpellates & castigates the man regarding
the first divine messenger: 'My good man, didn't you see the first divine
messenger that has appeared among human beings?'
"'I didn't, lord,' he says.
{103}
Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't you see among human beings a
tender baby boy lying prone in its own urine & excrement?'
"'I did, lord,' he says.
Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't the thought occur to you —
observant & mature: "I, too, am subject to birth, have not gone beyond birth.
I'd better do good with body, speech, & mind"?'
"'I couldn't, lord. I was heedless, lord.'
Then King Yama says, 'My good man, through heedlessness you did not do
what is good with body, speech, & mind. And of course, my good man, they
will deal with you in accordance with your heedlessness. For that evil karma
of yours was neither done by your mother, nor done by your father, nor done
by your brother, nor done by your sister, nor done by your friends &
companions, nor done by your kinsmen & relatives, nor done by the divines.
That evil karma was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.'
"Then, having interrogated & interpellated & castigated the man regarding
the first divine messenger, King Yama interrogates & interpellates &
castigates him regarding the second: 'My good man, didn't you see the
second divine messenger that has appeared among human beings?'
"'I didn't, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't you see among human beings a
woman or man eighty, ninety, one hundred years old: aged, roof-rafter
crooked, bent-over, supported by a cane, palsied, miserable, broken-toothed,
gray-haired, scanty-haired, bald, wrinkled, with limbs all blotchy?'
"'I did, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't the thought occur to you —
observant & mature: "I, too, am subject to aging, have not gone beyond
aging. I'd better do good with body, speech, & mind"?'
{104}
"'I couldn't, lord. I was heedless, lord.'
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, through heedlessness you did not do
what is good with body, speech, & mind. And of course, my good man, they
will deal with you in accordance with your heedlessness. For that evil karma
of yours was neither done by your mother, nor done by your father, nor done
by your brother, nor done by your sister, nor done by your friends &
companions, nor done by your kinsmen & relatives, nor done by the divines.
That evil karma was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.'
"Then, having interrogated & interpellated & castigated the man regarding
the second divine messenger, King Yama interrogates & interpellates &
castigates him regarding the third: 'My good man, didn't you see the third
divine messenger that has appeared among human beings?'
"'I didn't, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't you see among human beings a
woman or man diseased, in pain, severely ill, lying in her/his own urine &
excrement, lifted up by others, laid down by others?'
"'I did, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't the thought occur to you —
observant & mature: "I, too, am subject to illness, have not gone beyond
illness. I'd better do good with body, speech, & mind"?'
"'I couldn't, lord. I was heedless, lord.'
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, through heedlessness you did not do
what is good with body, speech, & mind. And of course, my good man, they
will deal with you in accordance with your heedlessness. For that evil karma
of yours was neither done by your mother, nor done by your father, nor done
by your brother, nor done by your sister, nor done by your friends &
companions, nor done by your kinsmen & relatives, nor done by the divines.
{105}
That evil karma was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.'
"Then, having interrogated & interpellated & castigated the man regarding
the third divine messenger, King Yama interrogates & interpellates &
castigates him regarding the fourth: 'My good man, didn't you see the fourth
divine messenger that has appeared among human beings?'
"'I didn't, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't you see among human beings
kings — catching a thief, a criminal — having him tortured in many ways:
flogging him with whips, beating him with canes, beating him with clubs;
cutting off his hands, cutting off his feet, cut off his hands & feet; cutting off
his ears, cutting off his nose, cutting off his ears & nose; subjecting him to the
'porridge pot,' the 'polished-shell shave,' the 'Rāhu's mouth,' the 'flaming
garland,' the 'blazing hand,' the 'grass-duty,' the 'bark-dress,' the 'burning
antelope,' the 'meat hooks,' the 'coin-gouging,' the 'lye pickling,' the 'pivot on
a stake,' the 'rolled-up bed'; having him splashed with boiling oil, devoured
by dogs, impaled alive on a stake; cutting off his head with a sword?'
"'I did, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't the thought occur to you —
observant & mature: "It seems that those who do evil actions are tortured in
these many ways in the here-&-now. And how much more in the hereafter?
I'd better do good with body, speech, & mind"?'
"'I couldn't, lord. I was heedless, lord.'
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, through heedlessness you did not do
what is good with body, speech, & mind. And of course, my good man, they
will deal with you in accordance with your heedlessness. For that evil karma
of yours was neither done by your mother, nor done by your father, nor done
by your brother, nor done by your sister, nor done by your friends &
companions, nor done by your kinsmen & relatives, nor done by the divines.
{106}
That evil karma was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.'
"Then, having interrogated & interpellated & castigated the man regarding
the fourth divine messenger, King Yama interrogates & interpellates &
castigates him regarding the fifth: 'My good man, didn't you see the fifth
divine messenger that has appeared among human beings?'
"'I didn't, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't you see among human beings a
woman or man, one day, two days, or three days dead: bloated, livid, oozing
with lymph?'
"'I did, lord,' he says.
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, didn't the thought occur to you —
observant & mature: "I, too, am subject to death, have not gone beyond
death. I'd better do good with body, speech, & mind"?'
"'I couldn't, lord. I was heedless, lord.'
"Then King Yama says, 'My good man, through heedlessness you did not do
what is good with body, speech, & mind. And of course, my good man, they
will deal with you in accordance with your heedlessness. For that evil karma
of yours was neither done by your mother, nor done by your father, nor done
by your brother, nor done by your sister, nor done by your friends &
companions, nor done by your kinsmen & relatives, nor done by the divines.
That evil karma was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.'
"Then, having interrogated & interpellated & castigated the man regarding
the fifth divine messenger, King Yama falls silent.
